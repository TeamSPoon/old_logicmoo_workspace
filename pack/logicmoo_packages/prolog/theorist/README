This direcory contains a compiler for Theorist.

The code is in "theorist.tex". This is both a Latex file and a Prolog
file (with one character change ---see the first few lines of the
file).  This should run under most Prolog's with standard Edinburgh
syntax.

The file "users-guide.tex" gives a users guide to Theorist showing
how it can be used. 

The files: "bats", "emu", "nqueens", "birdsfly", "hunt", "nrev",
"cir2", "lookslike", "depiction", "nixon" all contain examples.
See  the users-guide for details.

Another version of Theorist is available from Professor Randy Goebel
<goebel@cs.ualberta.ca>.
