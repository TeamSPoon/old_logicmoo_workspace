This archive contains a simulation of the ecological behaviour
of the Segura river which is developed in Curry.

We notice that the declarative model requires a Curry 
implementation including the Float type and the usual float 
arithmetic operators. This is not provided in our basic 
implementation "UPV-Curry" of the language. Hence, we have 
included here an slightly modified version of the UPV-Curry 
system which incorporates the above extension and is able
to execute the ecological simulation.

Here you can find the following files:

model_Segura.cur:     The declarative model of the Segura river.

upv-curry_float.pl:   The source code of the extended UPV-Curry interpreter.
            
prelude_float:              The extended UPV-Curry prelude file, which contains
                      the main data types and function declarations.

readme_modal_Segura:               This help file.

The UPV-Curry interpreter requires SICStus Prolog v3.x and it needs no
previous installation. 

You can use the UPV-Curry system as described in the 
"UPV-Curry User's Manual" available at "http://www.dsic.upv.es/elp/soft.html".
