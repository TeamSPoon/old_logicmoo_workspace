We provide a small tool to help you reusing old domains written in BACK V4 syn-
tax. We provide facilities to translate files readable for BACK V4 or for
MicroBack into Back V5 syntax.
Additionally you will be able to define your own translationrules. This mecha-
nism is explained in detail in the file "b5tf.pl". 

To use the tool you have to consult the file "translate/translate.pl".

With "v42v5(V4-filename,V5(new)-filename)" you will get a file, which is prob-
ably readable for BACK V50 with "backread(V5(new)-filename)".
We new 2 cases, where our translation is not sufficient:
 
- conjunktions and disjunktions of rolefillers have to be put into brackets.
  e.g "o is_a c with r : o1 and o2 and o3" will be translated in
        "o :: c and (r: o1 and o2 and o3)" . This has to be changed in
           "o :: c and (r:(o1 and o2 and o3))"
 
- aboxtells like "o :: c1 and (r1: X :: c2) and r2 : X" handled correctly in
  BACK V4, although they were syntactically forbidden,  are not longer allowed.

Comments as well as the readability of complex terms get completely lost within
the translation process.

mb2v5(MB-filename,V5-filename) is the same for MicroBack and V5. Note that
defaults cannot be read with BACK V50.
