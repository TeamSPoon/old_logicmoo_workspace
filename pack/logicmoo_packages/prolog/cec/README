1. Introduction

This is version 1.9 of CEC, which is short for Conditional Equational
Completion. In order to use CEC you need Quintus Prolog. It is known to run
under Quintus Prolog 3.1.1, on Sun workstations.


2. Installing

To install CEC change to directory ./obj/cec.  Edit the declarations at the
beginning of the Makefile according to your setup. Issue the command

% make cec

and wait. Make will automatically generate CEC for the machine type you use
(Sun 3 or Sun 4), the resulting executable is then called 'cec.sun3' or
'cec.sun4'. A log of the output during generation is kept in 'cec.log'.
Use 

% make install

to copy the executables to the ./bin directory and then

% make cleanup

to remove all intermediate files, uninstalled executables and logs from
the ./obj/cec directory.

Further documentation is in the ./doc/cec subdirectory.
