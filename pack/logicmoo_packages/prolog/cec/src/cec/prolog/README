The files in this directory are used to extend the interrupt menu of the cec
system.  This gives the user the possibility to interrupt a cec completion
in a controlled manner.


For a description of the predicates see "interrupt.pl".


In order to load these files do the following:

user@host(1): cc -c interrupt.c
user@host(2): qprolog
:- compile(interrupt).
:- establish_handler.


NOTE: Don't forget to adjust the quintus library pathname in "interrupt.c"
whenever you use these files on another machine.
Don't forget to change the name of the object file in "interrupt.pl"
(twice) if you have to rename "interrupt.c" due to name clashes.
