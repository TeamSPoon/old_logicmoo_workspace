"polGreater(+Interpretation1, +Interpretation2)."

Only useful with ordering "poly<N>".
If it succeeds, "Interpretation1" > "Interpretation2" holds true
(if > is the ordering on tuples of polynomials).
Interpretations (i.e. tupels of polynomials) of terms can be generated
via "polynomial(+Term, -Interpretation)".
