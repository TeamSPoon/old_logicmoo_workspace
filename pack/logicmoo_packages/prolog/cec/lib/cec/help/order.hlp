 
"order."

indicates the current type of termination ordering and asks the user to
change it to any of the following:

	     "neqkns", "kns", "poly<N>", "manual",

where <N> is a natural number denoting the tuple length of the interpretation.
Another possibility at this point is to read the ordering from a file.
In this case the option "file" should be chosen.
