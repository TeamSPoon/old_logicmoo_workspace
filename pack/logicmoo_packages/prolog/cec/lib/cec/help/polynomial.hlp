 
"polynomial(+Term, -Interpretation)."

yields the polynomial interpretation of "Term". It
fails, if the ordering is not 'poly<N>'. If there are operators in "Term",
for which no polynomial interpretation is known, the user is asked for
such an interpretation (and the given interpretation is stored).
