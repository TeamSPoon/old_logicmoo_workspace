 
"compile."

compiles the current set of rewrite rules into (compiled) Prolog. The 
compiled  rules  are  used  when  calling  "eval(+Term,-NormalForm)."
Later changes to the set of  rewrite rules  have no effect on  "eval" 
until a new call to "compile" is executed.

The predicate "norm" always  uses the current set of rewrite rules.
