"preregular."

succeeds if the current (order-sorted) signature is preregular,
and fails otherwise.

A signature is preregular, iff for every function symbol
f and every string w of sorts the set
   { t | there is a declaration f:w' -> t such that w=<w' }
is either empty or has a minimal element.

The preregularity condition is the regularity of Smolka/Nutt/Goguen/Meseguer 87.
