"regular."

succeeds if the current (order-sorted) signature is regular,
and fails otherwise.
The regularity condition is the one of Goguen/Meseguer 87.

A signature is regular, iff for every function symbol
f and every string w of sorts the set
   { (w',t) | there is a declaration f:w' -> t such that w=<w' }
is either empty or has a minimal element.
