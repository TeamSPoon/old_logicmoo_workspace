<h2>Reports (Rules and Policies)</h2><p>This file describes "BIT" (Bug/Idea/Typo) reporting, a system through
which you may notify the Ainur about problems in the game and/or your
suggestions of improvement.  It is presented in a FAQ form for easier
reading.
</p><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What is a BIT report?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>A BIT report is a short text message that you can send to the Ainur
to notify them about a problem in the game or to suggest a change.
In other games/environments such reports may be called "tickets" or
"support tickets".
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What types of reports can I make?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>There are four types of reports:
</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight:bold">bug</span> - A problem with the game code; something does not work or
does not work properly.
</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">typo</span> - Any problem related to descriptions: a misspelling, a 
grammar mistake, missing description, missing ID of an NPC, etc.
</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">idea</span> - A suggestion of improvement, of either particular room,
item, NPC, or the game in general.
</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold">commend</span> - Also known as praise; your means to express thanks
to the Ainur!
</li></ul></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: When should I submit a report?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>As for bugs and typos, you should report them as soon as you encounter
the problem, or if it is not immediately possibile (due to combat, PK
situation, etc.), at your next convenience.  As for ideas and commends,
well, whenever you like!
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: How do I submit a report?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>If your report concerns the room you are in or more general matter,
just type "bug", "idea", "typo" or "commend" depending on what type of
report you want to make.  If it concerns an object or an NPC, use
the report name followed by the object name, for example: "bug orc" or
"typo sword".  After that, you will be moved into the MUD text editor
where you can enter your report text.  When you are done, you will be
prompted whether the report concerns a global matter or the room you
are in.  After you answer, the reporting is complete.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What information should my report contain?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>This depends on the report type, but there are several general
guidelines:
</p><ul><li>Be as specific as possible.  A vague report that leaves us guessing
what you really mean is not very helpful.
</li><li>If you are reporting something about a room/item you are not 
currently inside/carrying, describe in detail where the report
subject lies/can be obtained from.  The MUD has thousands of rooms
and objects and just stating there's a typo in an emote of a "large
iron sword" is not enough; it is impossible even for experienced
ainur to know every item in game, not to mention remember their
file paths!
</li><li>(particularly for bug reports): Log, log, LOG!  In case of "odd",
hard to repeat bugs, log is the single most helpful information
you can attach.  If we know which messages from the quest you have
received and in what order, we are able to quickly track down the
problem.  So, every time you report a bug, paste in the log of your
actions just from before the bug occurred.
</li></ul></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What are the guidelines for idea reports?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>They are described in '<a href="idea.php">help idea</a>'.  Please read them before you submit
an idea report.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Should I ever contact an Ainu directly in addition to making a report?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>There are three cases where it is OK to contact an Ainu directly about
a bug.  One, you have found an unlimited gold bug.  Two, you are in a
life or death situation (in other words the bug is going to kill you
and there is no escape or the bug has killed you and may kill others).
Three, you are trapped due to a bug.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Why shouldn't I contact an Ainu directly? 
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>There are several reasons you should avoid contacting an Ainu directly.
This MUD has thousands of rooms and objects, and it is very likely the
Ainu you ask simply won't know the quest/room/item you refer to.  Also,
the Ainur are very busy, constantly working on making new areas and
updating old areas.  You may think that because a certain Ainu is a
Maker, Overlord, Power, etc., they must know the area you are going to
ask about and be able to assist you; however, you have to also consider
that each of these ranks holds extra responsibility and most of these
people do not have the time to drop everything and check out your bug.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What if what I think is a bug really isn't?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Do not worry about that.  It's better to report than not; the worst
that may happen is that you will receive a response stating it is
not a bug.  However, that does not mean you should not think when
you submit reports and submit them en masse; first make sure that
*you* have a very good reason to think that something is a bug.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: I made a report a few days ago and I want to check up on its progress.
What should I do?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>It is generally not a good idea to ask the Ainur for progress reports
on your report.  They are divided into different categories (report
files) and it is likely that the Ainu you ask has never seen your
report.  Also, we tend to have discussions on player reports
(particularly ideas) and that takes time.  In general, every time your
report is decided upon, you will receive a MUD mail that either states
the problem has been fixed/idea implemented, or that it has been
dismissed.  If you do not receive a mail, it means that the report is
still being decided upon, or simply waits for someone to have some free
time to look at it.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: I made an idea report and it was implemented but I did not receive a 
reward for it, what gives?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>This may mean that the Ainu simply forgot to mark your report as fixed
and reward you.  It may also mean that the idea was implemented based
on an idea report received from someone else (this happens quite a bit)
and yours either hasn't been seen or was discovered after the idea was
implemented.  If this happens then it is usually OK to ask someone if
they know what is up.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: I was rewarded for a report but I don't see the change in effect.
Should I report it again?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Not right away.  Quite often changes made will not take effect
immediately.  If it is a mudwide thing, it is safe to assume that the
change is waiting installation and/or reboot.  Only if the change isn't
present after reboot should you report again.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: I got a MUD mail about one of my reports from an Ainu asking for more
information.  What should I do?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>You need to reply to the mail as soon as possible and make SURE that
you include the text from the previous message in your response (use
the 'ri' mailer command rather than just 'r'), since the Ainu may make
several responses and might forget which report yours was regarding.
