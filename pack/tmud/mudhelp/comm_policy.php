<h2>Comm policy (Rules and Policies)</h2><p>This help file covers the guidelines for all publicly accessible
communication on our game.  This applies to (but is not limited to) all
comms and boards (including guild comms and boards), your character
information (description, legendinfo, title, surname, story, etc), custom
items and objects you are able to create, auction tags, etc.  Basically
anything that another player can read.  It is your responsibility to be
aware of the rules in this help file, and to follow them to the best of
your ability.  Being a text-based game, our public channels and boards
are at the heart of MUD communication, and we take these rules seriously.
</p><p>Our public channel/board rules are as follows:
</p><h3>1. Profanity </h3><p>The guideline for public profanity has often been compared to the
"PG-13" used for television and movies.  The technical definition of
PG-13 is: "Parents Strongly Cautioned. Some Material May Be Inappropriate
For Children Under 13."
</p><p>However, we interpret it a bit stricter than that, and there are many
topics, phrases and words said on network TV that are not acceptable here.
</p><p>Graphic sexual language, unmistakable sexually-related terms, clear
innuendo, harsh and/or excessive profanity, will not be tolerated.
</p><p>You would be ill-advised to test the boundaries of the profanity rules.
Your best bet is to keep it clean.  People intentionally walking the line
and looking for loopholes will be dealt with accordingly.  For more
information on this, help profanity.
</p><h3>2. Hate Speech </h3><p>No hate speech, racial, gender or sexual orientation slurs.  This
won't be tolerated, and if this rule bothers you, you should leave now.
Bigots are not welcome here.  Note that this includes misuse of sexual
orientation terms, like "gay", as well as slang misuse of words that
carry strong emotional charge, such as "rape".
</p><h3>3. Illegal Activities</h3><p>Our public channels should not be used to coordinate or discuss
activities currently illegal in the United States (where the server
resides).  This includes discussing illegal drug use.
</p><h3>4. Harassment</h3><p>Harassment of your fellow players will not be tolerated.  This includes
some of those cute little comments that some of you think are funny,
but are actually demeaning and create a hostile environment for other
members of the community.  See "<a href="harassment.php">help harassment</a>" for more information.
</p><h3>5. Advertising</h3><p>No advertising or selling of commercial services.  If anyone here
wanted to buy something, they would look elsewhere.
</p><p>This also includes those of you who wish to preach to the rest of
us - intelligent debates are allowed, sermons are not something the rest
of us want to hear - be it on the topic of religion, politics or any other
emotionally charged subject.  People come here to get away from the
vagaries of RL, and we don't want our public channels to degenerate into
religious or political flamefests.
</p><h3>6. Web Site Addresses</h3><p>While it is permissible to comm URLS, _NO_ obscene or vulgar URLs are
to be commed.  If the page your URL reference would itself break our rules
if its content were commed, don't comm it.  If a description of the site
contents on the comm would be in violation of comm policy, profanity or
any other rule, don't comm it.  Also, pursuant to the advertising rule
above, any website attempting to sell or market products or services is
forbidden.
</p><h3>7. Multiplaying and Quest Info</h3><p>Violations of multiplaying rules or questinfo rules is obviously
forbidden.  See "<a href="multiplaying.php">help multiplaying</a>", "<a href="questinfo.php">help questinfo</a>", "<a href="rules.php">help rules</a>".
</p><h3>8. Spamming</h3><p>Intentional spamming or flooding of the comm will not be tolerated.
This includes excessive drunken blithering.
</p><h3>9. Abuse of Ainur</h3><p>Insulting, taunting, harassing, baiting or otherwise abusing Ainur
will not be tolerated.
</p><h3>10. Thinking before Typing/Speaking</h3><p>Think before you act/communicate on the game.  It is easy to get worked
up and do something foolish, and we all get angry sometimes.  But we don't
have to let that anger force us to make bad decisions.  Take a deep breath,
count to 10, and consider the best way to react.
</p><h3>11. Other Games</h3><p>Using comm lines or boards to communicate with other players for the
purposes of coordinating other online games/environments, or to advertise
other games/environments (including other MUDs) will not be tolerated.
</p><h3>12. English on Public Channels</h3><p>English is to be used on all public channels; this includes, but is
not limited to, the main comm, guild comms, newbie comm, auction tags, etc.
Says, tells and other private communication, do not fall under this rule.
</p><h3>FAQ</h3><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Who determines what is "profane" or "harassing"?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>An important question.  The answer is that we, the Administrators of
the MUD do our best to determine what is acceptable. We try to define
these rules as clearly as possible in help files such as this, but
there are times when we must make on-the-spot subjective judgment
calls, based upon our experience, and hopefully, wisdom.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What gives you the right to police the comm?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>The Valar, the founders of this MUD, have charged the Powers with
maintaining certain standards on their MUD. These standards include
what should and should not be allowed on public boards and channels.
These rules are simply a fundamental fact of the MUD. While the
interpretation of specific rules may shift over time, the core
standards will not change, no matter how much you complain about it.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: I'm not sure if what I am going to say will violate one of the above
rules.  What do I do?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>If you can't make that judgment yourself, that's a good sign that it's
against one of the above rules.
</p><p>Think of it this way:
</p><ul><li>Would you say this in front of your parents?  Your grandparents?
</li><li>Would you say this to your teacher, or at work?
</li><li>Would you hear this on morning U.S. television?
</li></ul><p>If you answered "No" to any of the above questions, then you are well
advised to think of something else to say.  Keep in mind that of course
these are general guidelines and that everyone's family, work, and
school differs.
</p><p>If all else fails, and you still cannot determine whether what you
will be saying will violate one of the above rules, ask an Ainu.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: I'm going to say whatever I want.  What are you going to do about it?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Depending upon the judgment of the Ainur on duty (and ultimately the
Powers/Valar), if you violate the above rules you may either:
</p><ul><li>Be Verbally Warned.
You should heed a verbal warning. If you are verbally warned, and
persist in similar behavior, don't be surprised if you are formally
warned, silenced, imprisoned or deleted.
</li><li>Be Formally Warned.  
</li><li>Be banned from one or more comms for an indefinite period of time.
</li><li>Be Silenced, losing most communication privileges for an indefinite
period of time.
</li><li>Be Imprisoned.
Your character will be thrown in jail until the Power of Law can
address the situation.
</li><li>Be Immediately Deleted.
This is usually reserved for repeat offenders and people who are
obviously abusing the comm.
</li></ul></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: I was warned/silenced/deleted, and I don't think I deserve it.
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Stop.  Think about it again.  Are you sure you did not violate any
of the rules?  If you still think you have been wronged, make a
"law report" and politely state your case, and it will be considered.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: I think your comm rules are oppressive.  What do you say to that?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Sorry you feel that way.  One of our goals here is to make a safe
and reasonably clean environment on the internet for Tolkien fans
to play in and experience.  That means we police the public channels.
If this is not to your liking, you are free to leave at any time.
