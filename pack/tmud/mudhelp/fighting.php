<h2>Fighting (Player Guides)</h2><p>Combat is one of the basic activities on The Two Towers, as it is
the only means to advance your character.  This guide contains some basic
information on how to easily dispatch NPCs.
</p><h3>Becoming a better fighter</h3><p>First and foremost, the more skilled you are, the better you fight.
When you first start here, your skills and stats are at their lowest and
you will find that you may only take on the easiest of enemies.  However,
as the time progresses you will grow more powerful and will fight much
better.
</p><p>What factors in combat is your stats and your skills.  The former may
only be increased by profession trainers (and their increase is required
for levelling up: see '<a href="levelling.php">help levelling</a>'), while the latter will also
increase on their own while you use them (read: fight).  In fact, at low
skill levels, the increase of combat skills is fast enough that you should
not worry about training them at trainers for a while.
</p><p>The second thing that affects your combat performance is the weapon
and armour you use.  Without a weapon wielded, you will be using your bare
fists, which is not very effective.  Without armour, you will take a lot
more damage, which will require you to spend a lot of gold and time on
healing.
</p><p>There are many ways to obtain fighting equipment.  For new players,
every home town has a 'helper' NPC that can provide them with starting
equipment.  While not very good, it should suffice for the starter fights.
Later on, equipment can be obtained either from killed NPCs, quests or
shops.  As the NPCs that you can kill will probably carry weak weapons at
first, the two latter ways are preferable: there are quite a few quests
in the newbie areas that yield decent weapons, and shops are usually full
of mid-grade weapons that are just too weak for high level players, but
perfect for low levels.  However, when you decide to buy a weapon at a
shop, be aware that what you buy may be damaged; it is a good idea to
"handle" and "condition" the weapon before buying.
</p><p>After you reach 1d of character age, or advance up to level 3, you
will be able to use the auction system.  This is by far the best way to
get the best equipment in game for the lowest price; high level players
often have it in abundance, and auction the equipment to gain extra gold.
Auction prices are almost always much lower than shop prices for the
equipment, so you should take advantage of this system as soon as you can.
</p><h3>Combat</h3><p>Fighting on The Two Towers is fairly simple; the combat is for most
part automated, with the option of using various professional abilities
and specific items.  There are some basic combat-related commands that
you should be aware of:
</p><ul><li><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="consider.php">consider</a></span> - before you attack something, "consider" it to see if you
have fair chances of winning.  Even if an NPC attacks you on its own,
you should consider them while fighting to see if you shouldn't run
away!
</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="align.php">align</a></span> - If you wish to roleplay as a strictly good or a strictly evil
character, it is good to know if the NPC you are going to kill is
good or evil, and therefore is it "moral" for you to kill it.
</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="wear.php">wear</a>, <a href="wield.php">wield</a></span> - Commands that let you equip your armour and weapons.
Do not forget to wield your weapon before combat!
</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="wimpy.php">wimpy</a></span> - If you want a safe exit from combat, you may enable the wimpy 
mode.  With it turned on, you will automatically flee when your HP
fall low.
</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="kill.php">kill</a></span> - Your basic combat starting command.  Note that you can also
initiate combat by using professional abilities.  Typing just 'kill'
when your opponent is bleeding to death will finish them off, ending
the combat quicker.
</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="headbutt.php">headbutt</a>, <a href="feint.php">feint</a>, <a href="kickback.php">kickback</a>, <a href="multinock.php">multinock</a>, <a href="trample.php">trample</a>, <a href="cast.php">cast</a></span> - ... and many 
others, the professional abilities let you utilize your profession's
unique talents.  Similarly as with regular combat, you will start by
being very weak at using these, however with time your skills will
improve.  Unlike combat skills, they will not increase by use too
fast (and each attempt costs a sizeable amount of endurance points
too), so you will have to start training professional skills at
trainers eventually.
</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="shape.php">shape</a></span> - A very useful command that will tell you how badly wounded
your opponent is and thus how you are faring in your fight.
</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="hpq.php">hpq</a></span> - Display your current hitpoints.  This command is only somewhat
useful, as your HP and EP are displayed in your prompt by default.
Note, however, that prompt only refreshes after you type a command,
so it might be "outdated" if you just let the combat run; it is wise
to press ENTER every few combat rounds to see how many HP you really
have.
</li><li><span style="font-weight:bold"><a href="focus.php">focus</a></span> - A helpful command that lets you switch your combat tactics
slightly, focusing on any of the four basic combat skills.
</li></ul><p>Here is a short example of a battle with an orc as your opponent:
</p><pre><span>     Orc </span><span style="color:#b0b">scratches</span><span> you.
     You </span><span style="color:#f5f">hit</span><span> Orc.
     Orc </span><span style="color:#f55">hits</span><span> you </span><span style="color:#f55">hard.</span><span>
     You </span><span style="color:#5ff">inflict massive damage to</span><span> Orc.
     Orc misses you.
     You </span><span style="color:#ff5">massacre</span><span> Orc </span><span style="color:#ff5">with incredible force!</span><span>
     Orc falls to the ground.
     Orc is bleeding to death and needs to be bandaged!
     You killed Orc.
     Orc has died.
</span></pre><p>After the battle has ended, examine the corpse immediately; you may
find the corpse contains items and gold you want to take with you.
