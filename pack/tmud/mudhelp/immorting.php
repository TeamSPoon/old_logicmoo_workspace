<h2>Immorting (Rules and Policies)</h2><p>This document describes how you can become an immortal (an Ainu) to
help us expand and maintain the MUD.  Because of the volatile nature of
this subject, it has been written like a FAQ instead of a standard help
file.
</p><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What are the requirements to become an Ainu (immortal)?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><ol style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>You must be a member of the Two Towers community with an active
interest in joining Valinor as a contributing team member.
</li><li>You must have experienced a good portion of the game, and your
immorting character must have reached at least level 15.
</li><li>You must have at least one character that has reached an age
of 5 days.
</li><li>You must have a clean criminal record for at least 7 days.
</li><li>If a Newbie Maiar is deainured due to not completing the newbie
project in a timely manner, he/she will be reset to level six (6).
However, this will be decided on a case by case basis.
</li></ol><p>Once you have accomplished the above, you can use the "immort apply"
command, but be aware: if it is determined that you have been involved
in cheating of any form, you will not be considered as a candidate.
The decision of the Powers on this matter is final.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What information will "immort apply" ask me for?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><ol style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>You will be asked to list all your characters that you play or have
played, especially any that have been nuked, warned or previously
deainured.  Failure to do so will result in your immediate
deainurment or even a nuke.  You should also name the characters
that use the same connection/IP address that you use, but that
aren't your alts.
</li><li>Create a 10-line paragraph describing a (real life) room with which
you are familiar.  Do so in the style of a room in Arda, as if you
were inside the room, looking at it.  Use EXACTLY ten (10) lines.
If you can't follow directions in the application, your life as an
immortal will be quite short-lived.
</li></ol></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: When I become an Ainu, do I have to give up my mortal character?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Yes, the mortal character that requests immortality will be the new
Ainu.  There are rules regarding when you can play your other mortal
characters once you become immortal.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: How often can I play a mortal after I have an immortal character?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Let's just say that there are deadlines that must be met as a coder
for this MUD.  We need Ainur who are able and willing to contribute to
the game by coding new areas.  Especially during the first month or
two after you immort, you will find that learning to code will require
at least a couple hours each day.  If you are unable or unwilling to
put in the time, then you should reconsider becoming an Ainu.  Until
your first (newbie) project is complete, you will not be able to play
your mortals at all.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What if I am a GM or AGM?  Can I still immort and become an Ainu?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Yes and No. There are special rules and restrictions that apply, in
addition to the ones listed above, which are outlined below:
</p><ol style="list-style-type:decimal"><li>You cannot be GM or AGM, or have an alt that is a GM or AGM at
the time of applying or immorting.  You need to sever your ties at
least temporarily while going through the process of acclimating
yourself to your new duties and responsibilities as an Ainu.
</li><li>No Maia with a GM/AGM alt will be allowed to exceed the rank of Maia.
</li><li>The *Maia character* must be as active in Valinor as his/her GM/AGM
character or suffer deainuring.  There will be no compromise on
this requirement.  If you think you cannot put in as much time on
your Ainu character as you do on your GM/AGM character, then
immorting is not for you.
</li></ol></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What will I be doing as an Ainu?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>The language we use is a variation of the 'C' language called LPC. It
uses a custom library created especially for our MUD.  You will learn
to create rooms, creatures and objects using this code.  Valinor is a
team-based environment where we try to let people focus on their
strengths.  As such, some people end up primarily writing descriptions
while others end up primarily writing code.  However, everyone is
expected to do both simple coding and description-writing for their
solo newbie project, so that all Ainur have at least a basic knowledge
of the "full spectrum".
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Do Ainur do anything but code?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>There are Administrative ranks for Ainur, but they are higher ranks,
and all of these Administrators have done a LOT of coding on their way
up to their present level.  In short, yes, all Ainur code as their
primary job for at least the first two or three immortal ranks.  So if
you don't want to code, you better think twice.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Will I be able to help out my friends or do stuff to people I don't
like once I become an Ainu?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Yeah, right.  That's a good way to get nuked!  To summarize for the
sarcasm-impaired: NO YOU CANNOT.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Will I at least be able to talk to my friends once I immort?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Once you immort, you will not be allowed to be part of the mortal
world until you enter QC.  Make sure you say all your goodbyes before
you immort.  In other words, until you reach the QC stage of your
newbie project (where the project is done and being checked for errors
by the Overlords), you must stay Invisible to mortals and not interact
with the mortal world in any way (says, tells, mails, etc).
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Will I be able to nuke when I become an Ainu?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Well, not at first for sure.  Nuke is a very high level command that
only the top ranks have access to.  Eventually, anything is possible.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Will I get to be a Vala if I immort?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>There will be no more Valar, as the Vala rank denotes a founder.
However, the rank of Power (equal in responsibility to that of Vala)
is achievable, although it is very difficult for most.  Only a select
few get a shot at that, but if you work hard for us, and show that you
can be trusted, it is a definite possibility.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Do I get to change my name once I become an Ainu?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>You do not have the option to select a new name once you become an
immortal.  You must complete the requirements of the newbie project
before you can select one of the Tolkien'ish hero names.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Do you guys only allow the "good" players to immort?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Generally speaking we consider a person's attitude toward the game
more than their alignment.  If you have played within the rules, and
don't have a history of trying to exploit every loophole you see, then
you have a better than average shot.  As an immortal, we are more
interested in the person behind the characters than the characters you
have played.  As part of the process, you will be required to furnish
the names of all the characters you have played.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What if I have a criminal record?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>That is fine.  Our main requirement is that you do not commit crimes
for one week before requesting to be immorted.  This is because of the
lawsys, and we want the victims to be able to get their law-entitled
reimbursements.  Similarly, you are not allowed to immort if you have
outstanding fines or are wanted.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Do I have to be a master coder to be an Ainu?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Not at all.  LPC (the programming language we use) is fairly easy to
pick up, and we have lots of people and sample code laying around to
help you out if needed and you will have some time to learn, but for
many, writing descriptions is the most difficult part.  We can teach
you how the code works, but we cannot teach you to write in English.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: What if I find that I don't like it or can't manage being an Ainu?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>During your trial newbie period, if you can't make your deadlines, or
find that you just don't like being an Ainu, then you will be returned
to Arda as a mortal.  Unless you can commit the time and really want
to work, you should not try to become an immortal.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: Any last advice before I apply?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>Yes, the language -is- fairly easy to pick up.  However, if you have
had any prior programming experience then it will be easier for you.
If phrases like "function calls", "variable initialization", and
"loops" are brand new to you, then you will have more reading and more
work to do.  We're here to teach, and everyone wants you to succeed,
but the effort to learn must come from you.  This effort may require
more time for some than for others.
</p><p>We cannot teach you to write in English.  If English is not your first
language, or you have under-developed grammar skills, then you will
require more time for writing your project.  We have a process of
quality control where your project is reviewed for both programming
errors and for grammar and spelling errors.  If your descriptions start
out poor or non-existent, this process can take so much time that your
project falls  behind schedule and you may not make the deadlines.
</p><p>None of us are perfect, which is why we have QC, but you must make an
honest assessment of your own skills, because the deadlines are your
responsibility.  Not making the deadlines is grounds for deainurment.
</p><p>In the newbie domain, you will have deadlines for completing your
project.  Now, before you immort, you should examine your schedule for
the coming weeks.  Do you have the time to dedicate to learning and
creating?  We are aware that sometimes your real life situation will
change after immorting.  Once you choose to immort, however, you assume
the responsibility of completing your newbie project.  You may choose
to be deainured and attempt to remort again at a later date when you
have more time.  However, you won't be "on hold" as an immortal until
you have the time.
</p><p>This time is your proving ground.  It's the time to learn to be an
immortal.  It is actually one of the most difficult times in regards
to deadlines, reading, and learning.  Being an immortal can be very
rewarding.  It's extremely fun!  It is extremely tiring!  It's worth
it.  We hope you have the time to dedicate to meeting your obligations.
Remember, though, it is YOUR responsibility to meet your deadlines.
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: After I apply, how long does it take to become an Ainu?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>After you apply (using "immort apply") you can use the "immort status"
command to check on the status of your application.  If there are
already too many new Ainur being trained, you will be in a queue for
approval.  Once a spot opens up and you are the next in the queue, the
Administrators vote on your application.  If you pass the vote, you
will be immorted at your next convenience.  The wait for the whole
process is defined by how long the queue is, and you can see where you
are in the queue by using the "immort status" command.  In Valinor,
patience is truly a virtue!
</p></div><p style="font-style: italic">Q: I was an Ainu before, but was demorted.  When can I re-apply?
</p><div style="margin-left: 20px"><p>If you have already been an Ainu and were demorted, you can re-apply
after six months, at which point your application will be reviewed
and considered again.  Depending on the reasons behind why you were
demorted the last time, in addition to the usual compatibility and
potential factors, the Administration reserves the right to deny your
application without question.  Although we have no problems giving
people a second or even a fifth (or eighth) chance, some only get
so many before it's clear they simply do not belong in Valinor.
</p></div><p>Should you have other questions regarding immorting this FAQ does not
cover, or you cannot find the answer anywhere else, feel free to talk to
any available Ainu.  We are always on the lookout for new members who are
willing to help us make The Two Towers MUD bigger and better than it is!
