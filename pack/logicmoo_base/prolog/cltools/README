---+ Tools for Common Logic

A collection of tools for manipulating Common Logic texts. See http://www.common-logic.org

At the moment the functionality is rather minimal. You can

* convert a CL text to Prover9 format

* convert a (subset of a) CL text to a Logic Program

* perform a 'macro-expansion' on a CL text using axioms from another
  CL text (useful for turning syntactically second-order axioms to
  first order)

Also, if you have the Thea2 library
(http://github.com/vangelisv/thea/) then you can also generate OWL
(you will first have to define some kind of mapping of your predicates
to OWL axioms, in CL).

See translating vs embedding:

Coming soon:

* generation of HTML from CL
* generation of Latex from CL

Requirements: SWI-Prolog
