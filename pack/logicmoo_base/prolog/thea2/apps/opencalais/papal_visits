[[Pope Benedict XVI]] has not been as active in visiting other countries as his predecessor, [[John Paul II]], but has made several trips to foreign countries.

Most of these trips involve the Pope giving speeches on issues that play an important role in the region that he visits, especially those on education, contraceptives, abortion, and what it means to be Catholic.

Before a 3,400 audience, he called for compensation and demanded punishment for those guilty of the "evil": "Here I would like to pause to acknowledge the shame which we have all felt as a result of the sexual abuse of minors by some clergy and religious in this country. I am deeply sorry for the pain and suffering the victims have endured and I assure them that, as their pastor, I too share in their suffering." The Pope added: "Victims should receive compassion and care, and those responsible for these evils must be brought to justice. These misdeeds, which constitute so grave a betrayal of trust, deserve unequivocal condemnation. I ask all of you to support and assist your bishops, and to work together with them in combating this evil.
