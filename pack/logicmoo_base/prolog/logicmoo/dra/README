This directory includes the following files:

dra.ecl:
        A wrapping of dra_common.pl for Eclipse.

dra.pl:
        A wrapping of dra_common.pl for Sicstus.

drap.pl:
        A wrapping of dra_common.pl for SWI Prolog.  Safe for cyclic terms, but
        DRA can be 2.5 times slower than with Sicstus (examples/XSB/ham.tlp).

drapf.pl:
        A wrapping of dra_common.pl for SWI Prolog: this one makes DRA
        significantly faster than with Sicstus (on examples/XSB/ham.tlp).
        HOWEVER, it cannot handle cyclic terms, so is not to be used for
        programs with coinduction.

lib/dra_builtins.pl:
        This file contains declarations of built-in predicates that are
        allowed by the "dra" interpreter.  Support for many new predicates
        can be obtained simply by extending the table, but some may require
        special support from the interpreter.  In particular, addition of the
        cut would be non-trivial (and probably ill-advised).

dra_common.pl:
        The code for an interpreter that implements tabling by using "Dynamic
        Reordering of Alternatives".  This interpreter can handle programs
        that use not only tabling, but also co-logic programming (even when
        the same predicate is both coinductive and tabled).

        Just load 'dra' into Eclipse or Sicstus!  The head comment (better
        yet, the manual in "../doc/manual.pdf") explains how to use it.

dra_table_assert.pl:
        An implementation of the table of answers for DRA: answers are stored as
        clauses.

dra_table_record.pl:
        An implementation of the table of answers for DRA: answers are stored in
        the internal database.

examples/ex.tlp:
examples/ex2.tlp:
        Two trivial prototypical examples.  See how ex.tlp gives only one
        answer, because of the combination of coinduction with tabling.

examples:
        Some examples of tabled programs, all with the extension
        ".tlp".
