I have some questions about tabling and constraints.  It appears that
tabling does not work properly when a constrained variable in a tabled
subgoal is further constrained by an answer.  In the program above, we
have

| ?- {X < 10}, p1(X).
[x < 9.0000]
 { X < 10.0000 }   <-- should be X < 9

------------------

but answers work ok with unconstrained subgoal variables

 ?- p1(X).
 { X < 9.0000 }  <- ok

------------------

and  subgoal variables work ok if they are not further constrained.

| ?- {X < 10}, p2(X).
 { X < 10.0000 }
