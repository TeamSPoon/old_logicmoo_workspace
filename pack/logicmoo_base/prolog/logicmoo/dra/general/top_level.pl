%%%  NOTE: This code runs on Sicstus and Eclipse.  It may require some       %%%
%%%        tweaking for other Prolog systems.                                %%%
%%%                                                                          %%%

%%% NOTES FOR USERS:
%%%
%%%    1. To use this top level, just include it in your the file that
%%%       contains the code for your metainterpreter:
%%%
%%%           :- ensure_loaded( 'top_level' ).
%%%
%%%       Then load the metainterpreter into your logic programming system.
%%%
%%%
%%%    2. To begin execution by loading a new program, invoke
%%%
%%%           prog( filename ).
%%%
%%%       If the filename has no extension, the default extension will be
%%%       used if provided (see the description of "default_extension" below).
%%%
%%%       As the file is loaded, directives and queries are executed on-the-fly
%%%       by invoking the metainterpreter (except the ":- op ..." directive,
%%%       which is interpreted directly). A query is evaluated to give all
%%%       solutions (it is as if the user kept responding with a semicolon):
%%%       to avoid that use the built-in predicate once/1 .
%%%
%%%       After the file is loaded (and all the directives and queries it
%%%       contains are executed), interactive mode is started.  This is very
%%%       much like the usual top-level loop, except that the associated
%%%       metainterpreter -- and not the underlying Logic Programming system --
%%%       is used to evaluate queries and directives.
%%%
%%%
%%%       To just enter interactive mode invoke
%%%
%%%           top
%%%
%%%       To exit interactive mode enter end of file (^D), or just write
%%%
%%%           quit.
%%%
%%%       (the former method appears not to work with tkeclipse).
%%%
%%%       NOTE: 1. In the interactive mode one cannot input more than one term
%%%                per line.
%%%
%%%             2. When a query succeeds, the bindings of variables should be
%%%                printed upto a certain maximum depth.  The default value is
%%%                given in print_depth/1 below.  The maximum depth can be
%%%                changed from the interpreted program by invoking
%%%
%%%                   set_print_depth( N )
%%%
%%%                where N is a positive integer.
%%%
%%%                Please note that on some Prolog implementations (e.g.,
%%%                Eclipse) this might not prevent a loop if the printed term
%%%                is cyclic (as will often happen for coinductive programs).
%%%
%%%                Note also that the foregoing does not apply to invocations of
%%%                builtins in the interpreted program.  It is up to the user to
%%%                apply the builtin appropriate for the host logic programming
%%%                system.  For example, in the case of Sicstus, use
%%%                "write_term( T, [ max_depth( 10 ) ] )" rather than just
%%%                "write( T )", especially if you expect T to be a cyclic term.
%%%
%%%
%%%    3. To include files (interactively or from other files) use
%%%       the usual Prolog syntax:
%%%
%%%           :- [ file1, file2, ... ].
%%%
%%%       Please note that there is a difference between "prog( file )" and
%%%       ":- [ file ].".  If the former is used, the metainterpreter is
%%%       (re)initialised before loading the file (see description of
%%%       initialise/0  below); if the latter is used, the file is just loaded.
%%%
%%%
%%%    4. The program that is read in must not contain variable literals.  It
%%%       may, however, contain invocations of call/1.
%%%
%%%
%%%    5. The interpreted program may contain declarations of "top" and
%%%       "support" predicates, in the form of directives:
%%%
%%%           :- topl p/1, q/2.
%%%           :- support check_consistency/1.
%%%
%%%       The "top" declaration indicates predicates that will be called "from
%%%       the outside", so if they are not called in the program, there will be
%%%       no warning.
%%%       (This declaration is also recognized when translating coinductive
%%%        programs into Prolog: see "../coind/translate_colp".)
%%%
%%%       The "support" declaration means that the metainterpreter should treat
%%%       this predicate as a built-in, i.e., just let Prolog execute it.  This
%%%       can be useful for increasing the efficiency of interpreted programs
%%%       that make use of support routines that are written in "straight"
%%%       Prolog.  (Please note also that support predicates can use the full
%%%       range of built-in predicates available in the host logic programming
%%%       system.)
%%%
%%%       Predicates that are declared as "support" must be defined in other
%%%       files.  To compile and load such files, use
%%%
%%%           :- load_is_support( filename ).



%%% NOTES FOR AUTHORS OF METAINTERPRETERS:
%%%
%%%    6. The clauses read in by the top level are loaded into the module
%%%       "interpreted".  This is done to avoid conflicts with predicates
%%%       used in the metainterpreter (and the top level).  The metainterpreter
%%%       must access them by using the predicate imported from
%%%       "compatibility_utilties_...":
%%%           clause_in_module( interpreted, ... )
%%%
%%%       The predicates defined by these clauses are stored in the table
%%%       defined/1, in the form of patterns, e.g.,
%%%           defined( p( _, _ ) ).
%%%
%%%
%%%    7. The top level notes "support" declarations in the table "support".
%%%       For example,
%%%
%%%           :- support p/1, q/2.
%%%
%%%       will be stored as
%%%
%%%           is_support( p( _ ) ).
%%%           is_support( q( _, _ ) ).
%%%
%%%       The intended meaning is that "support" predicates do not make use
%%%       (directly or indirectly) of the special features provided by the
%%%       metainterpreter, so their invocations can be handled just by handing
%%%       them over to Prolog (which would presumably speed up the computation).
%%%
%%%       Please note that the support predicates (which should be defined in
%%%       files mentioned in ":- load_is_support( filename )." directives) are
%%%       compiled into the module "support" (unless they are defined within
%%%       other modules).
%%%
%%%
%%%    8. The metainterpreter should provide the following predicates
%%%       ("hooks") that will be called by the top level:
%%%
%%%          - builtin/1:
%%%                 Defines patterns for built-in predicates from the host
%%%                 system that can be invoked by the interpreted program.
%%%                 For example, to allow writeln/2, declare:
%%%                     builtin( writeln( _, _ ) ).
%%%
%%%          - default_extension/1:
%%%                 This predicate is optional.  If present, its argument
%%%                 should be an atom whose name is the extension string to be
%%%                 added to file names that do not already have an extension.
%%%                 (The string should begin with a period!)
%%%                 For example, a metainterpreter for coinductive logic
%%%                 programming might contain the following fact:
%%%                      default_extension( '.clp' ).
%%%
%%%          - initialise/0:
%%%                 This will be called before loading a new program,
%%%                 giving the metainterpreter an opportunity to
%%%                 (re)initialise its data structures.
%%%
%%%          - program_loaded/0:
%%%                 This will be called after a program has been read in from
%%%                 its file and stored in memory.  The interpreter can use
%%%                 the opportunity to check the program's consistency, to
%%%                 transform the program, etc.
%%%
%%%          - legal_directive/1:
%%%                 Whenever the top level encounters a directive
%%%                 (of the form ":- D."), it will call "legal_directive( D )".
%%%                 If the call succeeds, the interpreter will be given
%%%                 a chance to process the directive (see below), otherwise
%%%                 the directive will be ignored (with a suitable warning).
%%%
%%%          - execute_directive/1:
%%%                 Whenever the top level encounters a legal directive
%%%                 ":- D" (see above), it invokes "execute_directive( D )"
%%%                 to give the interpreter a chance to act upon the
%%%                 directive.
%%%
%%%          - query/1:
%%%                 This would be the main entry point of the metainterpreter.
%%%                 Whenever the top level encounters a query (of the form
%%%                 "?- Q."), it will display the query and then call
%%%                 "query( Q )".  Depending on the result, it will then
%%%                 display "No", or "Yes" (preceded by a display of bindings
%%%                 acquired by the variables occurring in "Q"); in the latter
%%%                 case it will also backtrack to obtain more solutions.
%%%
%%%
%%%    9. The metainterpreter can also define hooks of its own.  A hook
%%%       predicate should be declared in a fact of "hook_predicate/1".
%%%       For example,
%%%
%%%           hook_predicate( essence_hook( _, _ ) ).
%%%
%%%       declares that "essence_hook/2" is a metainterpreter hook.  A hook
%%%       predicate (essence_hook/2 in this case) should be dynamic.  When
%%%       the top level encounters a clause whose head matches a hook predicate
%%%       declaration, the clause is asserted at the front (!) of the predicate
%%%       (in the module of the running program, not in "interpreted").
%%%
%%%       NOTE: If the interpreter does not use hook predicates, it must contain
%%%             the definition
%%%                 hook_predicate( '' ).

%% NOTE: In Eclipse it is possible to use the module facility in a way that
%%       allows redeclaration of predicates that are built-ins, but that are
%%       not wanted (see below).  It is not obvious how to do it in Sicstus, so
%%       the interpreted program cannot define predicates whose names happen to
%%       clash with the names of built-ins. Hence in the Sicstus version
%%       the only modules that are created are "interpreted" and support.
%%
%% NOTE (Specific to Eclipse):
%%       In order to avoid name conflicts with the numerous built-in predicates
%%       of Eclipse, the only thing "interpreted" imports is the module
%%       "interface".  The module "interface" is created by the top-level from
%%       a declaration of built-ins allowed by the metainterpreter (and provided
%%       by the latter in table "builtin").  The difficulty is that Eclipse does
%%       not allow direct exportation of built-ins: this is solved by defining
%%       yet another module, called "interface_aux".
%%       The exact mechanics are best explained by means of an example:
%%
%%       1. Let the metainterpreter contain a declaration of only one built-in:
%%             builtin( writeln( _ ) ).
%%
%%       2. The top level will add the following clause to module
%%          "interface_aux" (which imports all the built-ins by default):
%%             xxx_writeln( X ) :-  writeln( X ).
%%
%%       3. "xxx_writeln/1" will be exported by "interface_aux".
%%
%%       4. Module "interface" will import only "interface_aux", and will be
%%          closed to default importation of built-ins.  It will define clause:
%%             writeln( X) :- xxx_writeln( X ).
%%
%%       5. "writeln/1" is now a user-defined predicate and can be exported from
%%          "interface".
%%
%%       6. "interpreted" will import only "interface", and will be closed to
%%          default importation of built-ins.  The interpreted program can use
%%          "writeln/1" and no other built-ins.  It can also define predicates
%%          whose names would normally clash with names of built-ins (e.g.,
%%          "connect/2", which might be useful in, say, a graph-processing
%%          application).
%%
%%       Please note that all this does not apply to "support".
