% I have replaced it with the following in the interest of "efficiency": if

% The worst-case cost should be about the same, i.e., quadratic in the length of
% the list (in the original version this is hidden within setof/3). [FK]

%% obtain_all_cyclic_subterms( + Term, - List ) :
%% Create a list of all the cyclic subterms of this term.
%% A "cyclic term" in this context is a term whose main functor is involved in a
%% cycle, as opposed to a term that only contains cyclic subterms.  For example,
%%    ?-  X = f( X ), obtain_all_cyclic_subterms( t( a( X ), b( X ) ), L ).

%% obtain_all_cyclic_subterms( Terms, SeenBefore, Root, Acc, Ans ) :
%%  - Terms are the terms that still have to be handled;
%%  - SeenBefore is the list of terms that have already been seen;
%%  - Root = root if we are at the root of the term;
%%  - Acc is an accumulator (for Ans);
%%  - Ans will contain the list of different subterms.
%%
%% Additional explanation (FK):
%% When first seen, a cyclic subterm is added to SeenBefore.
%% Since it is cyclic, it will be seen again, and at that point it will be added
%% to the accumulator. This ensures that a term that satisfies cyclic_term/1 by
%% virtue of containing cyclic subterms will not be put on the list unless its
%% main functor is actually a part of the cycle.
%% MODIFIED by FK:
%%    1. Replaced counter with Root (i.e., just a flag).
%%    2. Suppressed repetitions in the resulting list.
%%    3. Replaced the call to append/3 with a recursive invocation. So the first
%%       argument is now always a list of remaining siblings.  Notice that this
%%       change makes SeenBefore shorter, but that is a good thing. There
%%       is no need to check whether a sibling has been seen before: all we care
%%       about is whether this term is identical with one of its ancestors.
%%    4. Suppressed addition of siblings to SeenBefore.
