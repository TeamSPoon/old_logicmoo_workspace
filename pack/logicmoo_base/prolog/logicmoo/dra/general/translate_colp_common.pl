%%% General description
%%% -------------------
%%%
%%% This translator transforms "co-logic programming" programs into
%%% straightforward logic programs that can be compiled/executed in any
%%% logic programming system that does not incorporate the "occur check"
%%% in normal unification.
%%%
%%% The transformed programs may cause errors if they invoke built-in predicates
%%% that cannot handle cyclic terms (e.g., copy_term/2).
%%%
%%% NOTE: A transformed program cannot contain variable literals or invocations
%%%       of "call/1".
%%%       A transformed program cannot contain negative literals, unless they
%%%       are invocations of simple builtins or of predicates that were declared
%%%       as "support".
%%%       (Full negation will be provided in a forthcoming version.)
%%%


%%% Usage
%%% -----
%%%
%%% To translate a program contained in file "filename.clp", invoke
%%%
%%%    tc( filename ).
%%%
%%% (Notice that one can, but need not write down the extension ".clp".
%%%  However, to translate a file with a different extension one has to write
%%%  the full file name, thus : 'Foo.ext' .)
%%%
%%% The translator will read the program and --- if there are no fatal
%%% errors --- will write the transformed program on "filename.pl".
%%%
%%% NOTE: If "filename.pl" exists, it will be overwritten without warning.
%%%
%%% NOTE: A program that works in the coinductive interpreter should work almost
%%%       in the same fashion after it is translated and loaded directly into
%%%       Eclipse. The only difference should be that the interpreter executes
%%%       queries somewhat differently (more or less as if they were entered
%%%       interactively at the top level).
%%%       Unlike the interpreter, the translator does not act upon directives
%%%       that include files (e.g., ":- [ filename ].": such directives are
%%%       simply copied to output.  This is done on purpose, to allow separate
%%%       translation: if the file names are given without extensions, and all
%%%       the included files are also translated, then the effect of directives
%%%       in the translated program will be to include the translated files
%%%       (because the default extension will be different when loaded into
%%%       Eclipse).
%%%       There are, however, two directives that must be recognized. The first
%%%       is the operator declaration (i.e., ":- op( ... )") (and this is
%%        dealt with by "read_terms/2" in "utilities".  The second is
%%%       ":- table ...", which we must allow in order to process programs
%%%       that take advantage of both coinduction and tabling.  The translator
%%%       automatically transforms the predicate specifications in
%%%       ":- table ..." (unless they refer to predicates declared as
%%%       "support").
%%%       Moreover, the translator issues appropriate "essence_hook" clauses
%%%       that allow the implementation of tabling to strip the additional
%%%       "administrative" argument from instances of tabled predicates.  In
%%%       order to do that, it stores information about these predicates in an
%%%       internal table called "tabled".


%%% Directives
%%% ----------
%%%
%%% Queries will undergo the same transformation as clause bodies and be output
%%% with the translated program.
%%% In general, directives will be just copied to the translated program (i.e.,
%%% without transformation. However, there are two kinds of exceptions.  The
%%% first is ":- table ..." and ":- op( ... )", discussed above.  The second is
%%% that the following directives will be interpreted directly by the translator
%%% (and not copied):
%%%
%%% 1.
%%%     :- coinductive0 PredSpec .
%%%
%%%  (where PredSpec is of the form "p/k", or "p/k, q/k, ...": the item that
%%%   precedes the slash is the name of a predicate, and the item that follows
%%%   the slash is a natural number denoting the arity of the predicate).
%%%
%%%  These directives are treated as declarations of coinductive predicates.
%%%
%%% 2.
%%%     :- topl PredSpec.
%%%
%%%  These are treated as declarations of predicates that will be invoked
%%%  directly by the user or non-coinductive programs.  In the translated
%%%  program these predicates will be available also in their original form
%%%  (i.e., there will be no need to take the transformation into account by
%%%  providing an additional argument: see the description of the transformation
%%%  below).
%%%
%%% 3.
%%%     :- support PredSpec.
%%%
%%%  These are treated as declarations of predicates that should be treated as
%%%  "normal" logic programming predicates, and should, therefore, not be
%%%  subjected to transformation.  A declaration of this sort constitutes a
%%%  claim by the programmer that the "support" predicate will not invoke ---
%%%  directly or indirectly --- any coinductive predicates.
%%%
%%%  NOTE: 1. It is an error for a coinductive predicate to be declared as
%%%           "support".
%%%        2. It is not necessary to declare built-in predicates in this
%%%           fashion.
%%%
%%%
%%% Please note that the various declarations of predicates should precede their
%%% definitions.  (It is a fatal error if they do not.)


%%% The transformation
%%% ------------------
%%%
%%% A. Every "normal" predicate (i.e., one that has not been declared as
%%%    "coinductive" or "support") will:
%%%
%%%      1. have its name extended with an underscore;
%%%
%%%      2. receive an additional argument (at the end of the argument list):
%%%         the argument will carry around a data structure that contains the
%%%         set of coinductive hypotheses (in the first version the data
%%%         structure is just a list).
%%%
%%%    For example, the predicate
%%%
%%%            p( X, Y ) :-  q( X, Z ),  r( Z, Y ).
%%%            p( X, X ).
%%%
%%%    will be transformed to
%%%
%%%            p_( X, Y, Hyp ) :-  q_( X, Z, Hyp ),  r_( Z, Y, Hyp ).
%%%            p_( X, X, _   ).
%%%
%%%
%%% B. If a predicate has been declared as "top", an additional hook will be
%%%    provided to facilitate invocation.  For example, if the definition of
%%%    p/2 above were preceded by
%%%
%%%           :- topl p/2.
%%%
%%%    then the translator would output also
%%%
%%%           p( X, Y ) :-  p_( X, Y, [] ).
%%%
%%%    N.B. This feature is the reason predicate names are extended with an
%%%         undescore.  Our example program might well contain also occurrences
%%%         of p/1, which --- if the names were not changed --- would get
%%%         transformed to occurrences of p/2, and those would clash with this
%%%         additional "convenience predicate".
%%%
%%%
%%% C. If a predicate has been declared as "support", none of its occurrences is
%%%    transformed.  (This applies also to built-in predicates, with the obvious
%%%    exception of "meta-predicates" such as ",/2", "once/1" etc., some of
%%%    whose arguments are interpreted as predicates and must undergo the
%%%    transformation.)
%%%
%%%
%%% D. If a predicate has been declared as "coinductive", the transformation
%%%    is a little more involved:
%%%
%%%      1. the definition will be preceded by an additional clause that
%%%         nondeterministically queries the set of coinductive hypotheses;
%%%
%%%      2. the other clauses will extend the set of coinductive hypotheses
%%%         with an appropriate instantiation of the the goal that invoked them
%%%         (in the original form of the program).
%%%
%%%    For example, if the definition of p/2 above were preceded by
%%%
%%%           :- coinductive0 p/2.
%%%
%%%    then the transformed form would be (assuming the set of hypotheses is
%%%    represented as a list):
%%%
%%%
%%%           p_( X, Y, Hyp ) :-
%%%                   member( p( X, Y ), Hyp ).
%%%
%%%           p_( X, Y, Hyp ) :-
%%%                   NewHyp = [ p( X, Y ) | Hyp ],
%%%                   q_( X, Z, NewHyp ),
%%%                   r_( Z, Y, NewHyp ).
%%%
%%%           p_( X, X, _ ).
