%%% NOTE:
%%%
%%%    1. To load a program use the query:
%%%           ?- prog( filename ).
%%%       If the filename has no extension, ".clp" is added.
%%%
%%%       A coinductive predicate should be declared as such in the program
%%%       file, e.g.,
%%%           :- coinductive0 comember/2 .
%%%
%%%       To include files use the usual Prolog syntax:
%%%           :- [ file1, file2, ... ].
%%%
%%%    2. The program should contain no other directives. It may, however,
%%%       contain queries, which will be executed immediately upon reading.
%%%
%%%    3. If the program invokes a built-in predicate, that predicate must
%%%       be declared in the table builtin/1 (see file "colp_builtins.pl").

%%% LIMITATIONS: - The interpreted program should not contain cuts.
%%%              - Error detection is quite rudimentary.
