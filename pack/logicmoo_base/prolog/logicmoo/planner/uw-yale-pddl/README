This is release 1.6 of the Planning Domain Definition Language, PDDL.

Assuming you have gunzipped and untar'ed the directory, you will be
looking at the folowing subdirectories:

doc: Documentation, including a postscript version of the manual,
   which contains instructions on running the syntax checker and solution
   checker 
src: Lisp code defining the syntax checker and solution checker
domains: A directory containing a bunch of test domains, with each file
   containing a collection of related domains and problems, except
   for...
domains/transplan: A directory containing the transportation-planning
   domain for Track 3 of the competition
strict-domains: The same domains, arranged in a format preferred by
   some, to wit --- one subdirectory per domain, and, in each file in
   that subdirectory, either a single domain description or a single
   problem description.  (See the manual for an explanation of
   "strictness.")


Change history:

1.6 Changed logistics domain.  There are now just two versions: logistics-strips
   and logistics-adl.  There are several test problems that were generated by
   Selman and Kautz.

1.5 Fixed some bugs
    New domains:
      movie: From U. of Washington.  Probably used in competition
      assembly: Simple assembly task.  Designed to make life hard for
         total-order planners, but there are some interesting
         challenges for partial-order planners, too.

1.4 Fixed some bugs
    :vars now flagged if domain doesn't declare
        :quantified-preconditions and :conditional-effects  
    Introduced (solution-file-check soln-file prob-file) (see manual)
    Many domains cleaned up, strips versions supplied.  New domain:
        gripper from Jana Koehler

1.3 Fixed some bugs
    Cleaned up mystery domain.  There are now two versions, one strips, one 
typed.
    THIS IS A DOMAIN WE ARE PLANNING TO USE IN THE CONTEST

1.2 Fixed several bugs
    Added a new domain, mystery, with a hundred automatically generated 
problems

1.1 Fixed some bugs.  
    Changed definition of identifiers in PDDL, allowing hyphens in names
(Thanks to Jana Koehler for pointing out the inconsistency.)
    Kantrowitz defsystem is now included in the release.
