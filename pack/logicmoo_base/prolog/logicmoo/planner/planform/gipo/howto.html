<hr>GIPO is under continuous development.    
<p>For the sake of simplicity for the first version, GIPO was designed
  specifically for encoding domain models under general classical assumptions.
  This decision was purely for efficiency so that we could concentrate on experimenting
  with interface and integration issues. With the introduction of version 3 GIPO has experimental 
  support for domains requiring durative actions and numeric fluents, with roughly the expressive
  power of PDDL level 5.
  </p>
     
<p>GIPO Version 2 Added features to deal with Hierarchical domain definitions.&nbsp;
  </p>
<p>GIPO Version 3 Adds the Life History Editor for classical domains and  experimental 
  support for domains requiring durative actions and numeric fluents.
