<h2> Tristate Pattern</h2>
 A <font color="#ff0000">tristate</font> is an object that can typically
be in one of three states and can change between them. An example of a tristate
machine would be a simple coloured signal that moves from states red to orange
and orange to green and back from green to orange and from orange to red. 
A tristate is a form of linear machine where the machine forms a sequence
of states that can be traversed in either direction.<br>
