<h2> Bistate Pattern</h2>
 A bistate is an object that can typically be in one of two states and can 
change between them. A typical example of a bistate is a switch that can be
either off or on. The bistate is controlled by two actions a <font
 color="#ff0000">turn_on</font> action and a <font color="#ff0000">turn_off</font>
action. A bistate is a form of linear machine where the machine forms a sequence
of states that can be traversed in either direction.<br>
