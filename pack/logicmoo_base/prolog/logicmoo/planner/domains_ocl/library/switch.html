<h2>Switch Pattern</h2>
 A switch is an object that can typically be in one of two states and can 
change between them. An alternative example of a switch  is a door that that can be
either open or closed. The switch is controlled by two actions a <font
 color="#ff0000">turnOn</font> action and a <font color="#ff0000">turnOff</font>
action. A switch is a form of linear machine where the machine forms a sequence
of states that can be traversed in either direction.<br>
