I would like to add the following construction to the grammar: 
NP small clause. E.g. "Yossarian is a bombardier". Valuation n0N1
The problem is that the adjunction of the determiner is not mandatory, 
so I have to send Geni indef(b) bombardier(b) to make sure that I get it. 
I think that it would be easier for me to treat the copula as a transitive verb.

I FIXED this manually. 
The conjunction in this last sentence is done outside geni, see whether it can be done inside now.

Player: look at you
Frolog: you are seated and alive and not-so-easy-to-kill
Player: stand-up
Frolog: RACER error occurred.

You are seated is not an assertion, it's an inferred fact. The interaction above asserts seated in the player KB, 
when the player stands up, "seated" is not removed from the player KB and it becomes inconsistent.
