GIPO Source Installation Instructions

The source is distributed with the assumption that you will be compiling 
using Linux, but the instructions should work with other platforms though 
you will need the relevant binaries for the Sicstus Prolog run time system 
and you may need to adjust the classpath for java.

The code should compile with versions 1.4.2_(any) of the Java SDK it will not 
compile with Java 1.5

The distribution uses JGraph, JGraphAddons Java_cup and Sicstus Prolog
Java/Prolog interface classes. Look at the 
relevant licenses, in the docs directory and in README.html

To change the Ocl parser wou will need to download full versions of 
java_cup and JLex.

To compile uncompress the source distribution and from the gipo directory
give the command
 
javac -classpath .:jgraph.jar:jgraphaddons.jar:java_cup.jar:lib/sicstus3.11.1/bin/jasper.jar jplan/top/OclEd.java

To run the created executable edit the gipo-src shell script to reflect
the location of the distribution in your file system.

Enjoy
