<h1>The Planform Project</h1>

<p><i><u><font color="#3366FF"><font size=+1>Planform: An Open Environment
for Building Planners</font></font></u></i> is a 26 month long project
with a planned starting date of October 1st, 1999. It will be led by Prof
Lee McCluskey at University of Huddersfield, Ruth Aylett at the University
of Salford, and Dr Maria Fox and Dr Derek Long at the University of Durham.
Prof McCluskey will take responsibility for the management of the overall
project. The project is funded by the EPSRC, but it also will be supported
by the UK National Air Traffic Services Ltd, and CogSys Ltd.
<p><u><font size=+2>P</font>roject relevance</u>
<br>Projects such as those sponsored by ARPI and NASA have shown that large-scale
planning systems - such as SIPE-II and O-Plan - developed in research centres,
can be cost effective. AI Planning systems such as these are domain-independent,
that is, their algorithms and representational facilities are logically
separate from the model of a particular application domain. These systems
have been criticised, however, for their theoretical opacity and lack of
a sound logical basis. Construction of the domain model needed for an application
has been shown in practice to be very slow and laborious, requiring expertise
not only in the applications domain but in the detailed working of the
planning system. It is generally agreed that the 'hand-crafted' approach
to domain model construction currently in use must be replaced by stronger
and more consistent methods which can compete successfully with more conventional
approaches in terms of software lifecycle costs.
<p>A related methodological problem is the difficulty of validating research
claims based on empirical evidence gathered from the application of planning
algorithms to domain models. While there are commonly used applications
for testing planners, and some syntactic conventions and `standard' domain
languages, there are, as yet, no precise planning ontologies that would
provide a medium for exchange in the AI Planning community.
<p><u><font size=+2>A</font>ims and objectives</u>
<br>We aim to research, develop and evaluate a method and supporting high
level research platform for the <i>systematic construction</i> of planner
domain models and abstract specifications of planning algorithms, and their
<i>automated
synthesis</i> into sound, efficient programs that generate and execute
plans. Our objectives are to:
<ol>
<li>
assemble an open environment based on an extensible core language (CL)
for the internal representation of planning entities such as objects, object
classes, states, invariants, actions, plans and execution architectures.
The environment will contain a set of tools for domain model acquisition
and validation and for interfacing with other formalisms;</li>

<li>
create a specification language (SL), based on CL. This will allow a specifier
to capture the characteristics of a range of planning algorithms,&nbsp;
and to determine the type of operations and the search strategy that the
target planner will perform;</li>

<li>
create a planning synthesis tool which inputs an application domain model
in CL, and a declarative specification of a suitable planner in SL, and
compiles them into a planning application;</li>

<li>
identify features of domain models that characterise the planning strategies
suited to them, and to explore the scope for automated selection of planner
strategy based on properties of the domain model;</li>

<li>
evaluate the scope and limitations of the approach by the acquisition and
exploration of domain models and planner specifications.</li>
</ol>
<u><font size=+2>P</font>roject operation</u>
<br>The project will proceed in phases, and will involve the development
of (a) domain models of real planning applications; (b) languages for encoding
these models; (c) tools for helping model acquisition and validation; (d)
languages for encoding specifications of planner components; (d) tools
for creating planning programs from domain models and planner specifications.
<p><u><font size=+2>P</font>roject context</u>
<br>The three universities involved in this project have an excellent record
in automated planning research, and form an internationally competitive
team.
