<h3>
To Define Hierarchical States</h3></center>
In a hierarchical domain the state editor is modified relative to the state
editor for "flat" domains. The hierarchical version will be displayed if
the domain is recorded as being hierarchical in the momain properties dialog.

<p>In heirarchical domains state is defined relative to the sort of an
object as it is for flat domains but for hierarchical domains the description
is partitioned against the sorts forming a path from a leaf sort to the
root sort. You can therefore define states at different levels of generality.
In figure 1 we see the state being defined for a vehicle which is in the
right hand <b><i>State Definitions </i></b>pane defined as being either
"<i>moveable </i>and<i> available</i>" or as being "<i>moveable </i>and<i>
busy</i>" but a complete characterisation of the state would also include
the inherited predicate "at(Vehicle,Location)" as shown in the <b><i>Inherited
State</i></b> pane. Legal states for objects which only occur at leaf nodes
in the sort tree are formed from the cross products of the state definitions
in the path from the leaf node to the root node.

<center>Figure 2 - Controlling State Definition Variables</center>

<p>In the process of defining such hierarchical states it may be necessary
to control the nature of the bindings of the variables appearing in the
predicates defining the current level state relative to the variables in
the inherited state. This is done by selecting a variable in the <b><i>Editable
State</i></b> and the right clicking to bring up a popup menu to allow
the appropriate controlling actions to take place. In the example in Figure
2 we see that this process has already been completed once in order to
restrict the sort of <b><i>V1</i></b> to be a <b><i>traincar</i></b> and
the process being carried out a second time perhaps to restrict the sort
of <b><i>RailV</i></b> to be a <b><i>train</i></b>. In a similar manner
if variables in the inheritaed state are selected then matching variables
in the <b><i>Editable State</i></b> are selected it is possible to ensure
that the relative bindings are controlled.
