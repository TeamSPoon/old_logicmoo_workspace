GIPO(Graphical Interface for Planning with Objects) is an experimental GUI and tools environment for building planning domain models. 
It was written by Ron Simpson and Weihong
Zhao of the Univ of Huddersfield as one output of the <a href="http://planform.hud.ac.uk"> PLANFORM </a>project from the Univ of Huddersfield, UK, 
with partners at the Univ of Salford and Univ of Durham.<p>

GIPO is under continuous development, with a final version to appear in 2002. 
As it is the result of a research project, it is free.

<h2>Rationale</h2>
<ol>
<li> Planning Domain Models are hard to
design, write, debug, maintain - even for experts. The process
of encoding is laborious. Bugs are of various types and 
can lurk in models for a long time. 
Presently, many domain model authors use planners themselves
to try to develop and debug a domain model. Planners have not generally
been designed for this purpose,<p>

<li> A notation that is good for encoding and validation may
_not_ be good for use with a particular class of planners.
There is a need for translators from the encoding language
to the input language for a taget planner. Further, with an
increase in the number of useful tools and techniques  
surrounding planning, there is a need to integrate these
into a tools environment.<p>

<li> As planners and planning applications become larger, the
problems of engineering planning domain models become more
accute. There is a need to research into engineering environments
and explore their synergy with general purpose planners.<p>
</ol>

<h2>Basic Functions</h2>

GIPO allows a user to create new domain models or
import and change old ones. It features:<p>
<ol>
<li> Syntax and Semantic checks for individual components
of a model<p>

<li> Semantic cross checking between components<p>

<li> Graphical construction of domain operators<p>

<li> Import/Export facilities for PDDL models<p>

<li> a planner stepper<p>

<li> a plan animator<p>

<li> a random task generator<p>
</ol>
