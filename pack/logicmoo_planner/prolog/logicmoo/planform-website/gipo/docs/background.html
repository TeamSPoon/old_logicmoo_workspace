<b><font size=+1>GIPO - Rationale</font></b>
<p>1. Planning Domain Models are hard to
<br>design, write, debug, maintain - even for experts. The process
<br>of encoding is laborious. Bugs are of various types and
<br>can lurk in models for a long time.
<br>Presently, many domain model authors use planners themselves
<br>to try to develop and debug a domain model. Planners have not generally
<br>been designed for this purpose,
<p>2. A notation that is good for encoding and validation may
<br>_not_ be good for use with a particular class of planners.
<br>There is a need for translators from the encoding language
<br>to the input language for a taget planner. Further, with an
<br>increase in the number of useful tools and techniques
<br>surrounding planning, there is a need to integrate these
<br>into a tools environment.
<p>3. As planners and planning applications become larger, the
<br>problems of engineering planning domain models become more
<br>accute. There is a need to research into engineering environments
<br>and explore their synergy with general purpose planners.
<p><b>What is GIPO?</b>
<p>GIPO (Graphical Interface for Planning with Objects)
<br>is an experimental GUI and tools environment for building
<br>planning domain models. It is under continuous development,
<br>with a final version to appear in 2002. As it is the result of
<br>a research project, it is free.
<p><b>What are its basic functions?</b>
<p>GIPO allows a user to create new domain models or
<br>import and change old ones. It features:
<p>1. Syntax and Semantic checks for individual components
<br>of a model
<p>2. Semantic cross checking between components
<p>3. Graphical construction of domain operators
<p>4. Import/Export facilities for PDDL models
<p>5. a planner stepper
<p>6. a plan animator
<p>7. a random task generator
<p>ETC
<p><b>What are its limitations?</b>
<p>1. For the sake of simplicity for this first version,
<br>GIPO has been designed specifically for encoding
<br>domain models under general classical assumptions.
<br>This decision is purely for efficiency so that we can
<br>concentrate on experimenting with interface and
<br>integration issues.
<p>2. GIPO has been written within a research project and
<br>is not a "software product". Hence, it is still
<br>under evaluation.
<p><b>Where can I find out more about GIPO?</b>
<p>GIPO is one output of the PLANFORM project
<br>from the Univ of Huddersfield, UK, with partners
<br>at the Univ of Salford and Univ of Durham.
<p>GIPO was written by Ron Simpson &lt;<i>r.m.simpson@hud.ac.uk</i>> and
Weihong
<br>Zhao &lt;<i>w.zhao@hud.ac.uk</i>> of the Univ of Huddersfield.
