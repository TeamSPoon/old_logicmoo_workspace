<h2 align=center>1. Introduction</h2>

The object-centred family of languages (OCL) and their associated development method forms a rigorous approach to capture the functional requirements of classical planning domains. OCL has been developed over the years at the University of Huddersfield. <p>

The approach of the object-centred method could be summed up as providing a tool-supported language for domain modellers to engineer the capture of
planning domain models, and then subsequently operationalise those models. 
The idea is to provide the domain developer with a structured language that 
allows models to be constructed, statically validated
and maintained with relative ease. <p>

This approach utilises the notion of ``lifting'' a domain model from the
level of the literal to the level of a more abstract object-centred 
representation. As well as helping in the development of a domain 
model, the object-centred
representation has advantages in the development and resulting efficiency
of planning algorithms.
OCL has a set of planning support tools which are continually being developed.
The tools provide the modeller with opportunities to improve the model
with respect to its fit with the domain and its completeness and efficiency
when used at planning time. For example, a random task generator tool can
automatically generate random tasks for any sound model in OCL, without the
need for domain-specific software. <p>

In this manual we introduce OCL using the concrete syntax of OCL<font valign=bottem size=-1>h</font>,
the language variant that can be used for both precondition planning
and HTN planning.<p>
