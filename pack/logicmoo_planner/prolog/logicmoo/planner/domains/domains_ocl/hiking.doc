The Hiking Domain -- Lee McCluskey -- Sept 01

1. INTRODUCTION

Over the summer with thoughts on a walking holiday
I tried to work out the logistics of doing a more or
less circular route over several days.
Using the real experience I've come up with a nice new problem domain.
Its fairly easy and natural to explain, but leads to 
planning problems that seem hard for some goal-directed
planners to solve, although the goal space is not very large.

Imagine you want to walk
with your partner a long clockwise circular route 
over several days (e.g. in the "Lake District" in NW England), 
and you do one "leg" each day. You want to start at a certain
point and do the walk in one direction, without ever
walking backwards. You have two cars which you must use
to carry your tent/luggage and to carry you and your partner
to the start/end of a leg, if necessary. Driving a car
between any two points is allowed, but walking must
be done with your partner and must start from the
place where you left off. As you will be tired when
you've walked to the end of a leg, you must have
your tent up ready there so you can sleep the
night before you set off to do the next leg
the morning.

The domain can has some interesting extensions if you
add more couples, cars or if you introduce duration etc

2. EXAMPLE RUN

Imagine we have four legs between 5 areas:

Keswick - Helvelyn - Fairfield - Honister - Derwent

The initial state could be:

at(car1,keswick), at(car2,keswick),
walked(couple1,keswick) at(sue,keswick), 
at(fred,keswick), at(tent1,keswick), up(tent1).

The "main" goal would then be:

walked(couple1,derwent)

where sue and fred form couple1.

I tried some "old" goal directed planners but
they were no use. FF took 5.24 seconds to come up with this
non-optimal 31 operator solution (I think the
optimal one is about 24 ops?).
Notice how Sue gets to put the tent down but Fred
always has to put it up!

3. NOTES ON THE FORMULATION

I created the domain in ocl using our Graphic tool GIPO,
auto-translated it to pddl, and used FF to solve
some problems.

- because our ocl2pddl  program can't translate
hierarchies/multiple inheritance etc
(yet) we've had to flatten it out with
specific "at"s.

- because of lack of handling of conditional ops in some
planners etc I have 2 formulations, a conditional 
one and a non-conditional one. The latter  is a little 
awkward:  cars are two seaters and we have 4 car moving
operators: drive, drive with tent, 
drive with passenger, drive with passanger and tent.
