 *  Description:
 *    Over the summer with thoughts on a walking holiday
 *    I tried to work out the logistics of doing a more or
 *    less circular route over several days.
 *    Using the real experience I've come up with a nice new problem
 *    domain. Its fairly easy and natural to explain, but leads to
 *    planning problems that seem hard for some goal-directed
 *    planners to solve, although the goal space is not very large.
 *    
 *    Imagine you want to walk
 *    with your partner a long clockwise circular route
 *    over several days (e.g. in the "Lake District" in NW England),
 *    and you do one "leg" each day. You want to start at a certain
 *    point and do the walk in one direction, without ever
 *    walking backwards. You have two cars which you must use
 *    to carry your tent & luggage and to carry you and your partner
 *    to the start and end of a leg, if necessary. Driving a car
 *    between any two points is allowed, but walking must
 *    be done with your partner and must start from the
 *    place where you left off. As you will be tired when
 *    you've walked to the end of a leg, you must have
 *    your tent up ready there so you can sleep the
 *    night before you set off to do the next leg
 *    the morning.
 *    
 *    The domain can has some interesting extensions if you
 *    add more couples, cars or if you introduce duration etc
 *    
 *    This version does not use conditional transitions
