These files were used to evaluate the performance of our approach+FF/FFx
against tlplan. In both Logistics and ZenoTravel domains problems have
names p*.pl. 

However, in the Robots domains, there are three types of
problems. Some of these where used in the comparison agains Kabanza's
& Thiebaux  extension of tlplan (pkt*.pl). Not all problems were actually
included in the ICAPS/AAAI papers. The file exps.xls contains more
details.
