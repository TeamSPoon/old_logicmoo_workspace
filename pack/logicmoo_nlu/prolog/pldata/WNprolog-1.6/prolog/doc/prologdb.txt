wn_pl - description of Prolog database files

DESCRIPTION

The files wn_ * .pl contain the WordNet database in a prolog-readable
format. A prolog interface to WordNet is not implemented.

The prolog database is very large and may take many minutes to load into the
Prolog workspace. A separate file has been created for each WordNet relation
giving the user the ability to load only those parts of the database that
they are interested.

See FILES , below, for a list of the database files and wndb(5WN) and
wninput(5WN) for detailed descriptions of the various WordNet relations
(referred to as operators in this manual page).

File Format

Each prolog database file contains information corresponding to the synsets
and word senses contained in the WordNet database. In the prolog version of
the database, the synset_id s (defined below) are used as unique synset
identifiers.

Each line of a file contains an operator that corresponds to a WordNet
relation. All lines with the same operator value are stored in the file wn_
operator .pl .

The general format of a line in a prolog database file is as follows:

     operator(field1, ... ,fieldn).

Each line contains the name of the operator, followed by a left parenthesis,
a comma-separated list of fields, a right parenthesis, and a period. Note
there are no spaces, and each line is terminated with a newline character.

Operators

Each WordNet relation is represented in a separate file by operator name.
Some operators are reflexive (i.e. the "reverse" relation is implicit). So,
for example, if x is a hypernym of y , y is necessarily a hyponym of x . In
the prolog database, reflected pointers are usually implied for semantic
relations.

Semantic relations are represented by a pair of synset_id s, in which the
first synset_id is generally the source of the relation and the second is
the target. If two pairs synset_id , w_num are present, the operator
represents a lexical relation between word forms.

s(synset_id,w_num,'word',ss_type,sense_number,tag_state).

     A s operator is present for every word sense in WordNet. In
     wn_s.pl , w_num specifies the word number for word in the synset.

g(synset_id,'(gloss)').

     The g operator specifies the gloss for a synset.

hyp(synset_id,synset_id).

     The hyp operator specifies that the second synset is a hypernym of
     the first synset. This relation holds for nouns and verbs. The
     reflexive operator, hyponym, implies that the first synset is a
     hyponym of the second synset.

ent(synset_id,synset_id).

     The ent operator specifies that the second synset is an entailment
     of first synset. This relation only holds for verbs.

sim(synset_id,synset_id).

     The sim operator specifies that the second synset is similar in
     meaning to the first synset. This means that the second synset is
     a satellite the first synset, which is the cluster head. This
     relation only holds for adjective synsets contained in adjective
     clusters.

mm(synset_id,synset_id).

     The mm operator specifies that the second synset is a member
     meronym of the first synset. This relation only holds for nouns.
     The reflexive operator, member holonym, can be implied.

ms(synset_id,synset_id).

     The ms operator specifies that the second synset is a substance
     meronym of the first synset. This relation only holds for nouns.
     The reflexive operator, substance holonym, can be implied.

mp(synset_id,synset_id).

     The mp operator specifies that the second synset is a part meronym
     of the first synset. This relation only holds for nouns. The
     reflexive operator, part holonym, can be implied.

cs(synset_id,synset_id).

     The cs operator specifies that the second synset is a cause of the
     first synset. This relation only holds for verbs.

vgp(synset_id,synset_id).

     The vgp operator specifies verb synsets that are similar in
     meaning and should be grouped together when displayed in response
     to a grouped synset search.

at(synset_id,synset_id).

     The at operator defines the attribute relation between noun and
     adjective synset pairs in which the adjective is a value of the
     noun. For each pair, both relations are listed (ie. each synset_id
     is both a source and target).

ant(synset_id,w_num,synset_id,w_num).

     The ant operator specifies antonymous word s. This is a lexical
     relation that holds for all syntactic categories. For each
     antonymous pair, both relations are listed (ie. each
     synset_id,w_num pair is both a source and target word.)

sa(synset_id,w_num,synset_id,w_num).

     The sa operator specifies that additional information about the
     first word can be obtained by seeing the second word. This
     operator is only defined for verbs and adjectives. There is no
     reflexive relation (ie. it cannot be inferred that the additional
     information about the second word can be obtained from the first
     word).

ppl(synset_id,w_num,synset_id,w_num).

     The ppl operator specifies that the adjective first word is a
     participle of the verb second word. The reflexive operator can be
     implied.

per(synset_id,w_num,synset_id,w_num).

     The per operator specifies two different relations based on the
     parts of speech involved. If the first word is in an adjective
     synset, that word pertains to either the noun or adjective second
     word. If the first word is in an adverb synset, that word is
     derived from the adjective second word.

fr(synset_id,f_num,w_num).

     The fr operator specifies a generic sentence frame for one or all
     words in a synset. The operator is defined only for verbs.

Field Definitions

A synset_id is a nine byte field in which the first byte defines the
syntactic category of the synset and the remaining eight bytes are a
synset_offset , as defined in wndb(5WN) , indicating the byte offset in the
data. pos file that corresponds to the syntactic category.

The syntactic category is encoded as:

     1    NOUN
     2    VERB
     3    ADJECTIVE
     4    ADVERB

w_num , if present, indicates which word in the synset is being referred to.
Word numbers are assigned to the word fields in a synset, from left to
right, beginning with 1. When used to represent lexical WordNet relations
w_num may be 0, indicating that the relation holds for all words in the
synset indicated by the preceding synset_id . See wninput(5WN) for a
discussion of semantic and lexical relations.

ss_type is a one character code indicating the synset type:

     n    NOUN
     v    VERB
     a    ADJECTIVE
     s    ADJECTIVE~SATELLITE
     r    ADVERB

sense_number specifies the sense number of the word, within the part of
speech encoded in the synset_id , in the WordNet database.

word is the ASCII text of the word as entered in the synset by the
lexicographer, with spaces replaced by underscore characters (_ ). The text
of the word is case sensitive. An adjective word is immediately followed by
a syntactic marker if one was specified in the lexicographer file. A
syntactic marker is appended, in parentheses, onto word without any
intervening spaces. See wninput(5WN) for a list of the syntactic markers for
adjectives.

Each synset has a gloss that may contain a definition, one or more example
sentences, or both. Note that glosses are enclosed in single forward quotes
and parentheses: '(gloss)'.

f_num specifies the generic sentence frame number for word w_num in the
synset indicated by synset_id . Note that when w_num is 0 , the frame number
applies to all words in the synset. If non-zero, the frame applies to that
word in the synset.

In WordNet, sense numbers are assigned as described in wndb(5WN) . tag_state
is 1 if the sense number was assigned based on frequency of use, and 0 if it
was not.

NOTES

Since single forward quotes are used to enclose character strings, single
quote characters found in word and gloss fields are represented as two
adjacent single quote characters.

The load time can be greatly reduced by creating "object language" versions
of the files, an option that is supported by some implementations, such as
Quintus Prolog. For example, on a Sun-4, Quintus Prolog took 15 minutes to
consult wn_s.prolog , but the object language version of the file loaded in
just 11 seconds.
