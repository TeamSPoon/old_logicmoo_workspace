To install gSOAP, unpack the archive. You will get the files:

INSTALL.txt	this file
README.txt
license.pdf	gSOAP public license
soapcpp2	executable gSOAP 2 compiler
soapdoc2.html	documentation for gSOAP 2
soapdoc2.pdf	documentation for gSOAP 2
stdsoap2.h	header file for stdsoap2.c[pp]
stdsoap2.c	library and gSOAP runtime
stdsoap2.cpp	library (identical to stdsoap2.c)

If any of the above files is missing, please contact us:
	http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soapcontact.html

Examples are included. Also a Linux/Unix Makefile is included.

ck.h ckclient.cpp ckserver.cpp:		 Cookie client and server example
dime.h dimeclt.cpp dimesrv.cpp:		 Image client and server with DIME
glossary.h glossary.cpp:		 Glossary client

polymorph.h polymorph.cpp:		 Polymorphic object exchange
quote.h quote.c				 Get delayed stock quote
quote2.h quote2.c			 Get delayed stock quote (SOAP messages)
quote3.h quote3.cpp			 Get delayed stock quote (Stock class)
quotex.h quotex.cpp:			 Combined client/server example
ssl.h sslclient.c sslserver.c:		 SSL example (requires OpenSSL)
uddi.h uddi.cpp:			 UDDI client
whois.h whois.cpp:			 Who-is example client

To build the example services and clients, type "make". See
	http://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/soapexamples.html
for more details and explanations of these examples.

Two multi-threaded stand-alone SOAP servers are included in the Linux/Unix
distributions:

mtmagicserver	MT magic square server (type 'make mtmagicserver.cgi')
sslserver	example SSL-secure SOAP server (client code: sslclient)

To try the SSL-secure SOAP server, install OpenSSL and change the occurrences
of "linprog2.cs.fsu.edu" in sslclient.c and sslserver.c to the machine name
(or machine IP) you are using. Example .pem files are included but you need to
create your own .pem files (see OpenSSL documentation).

The sslclient and sslserver codes can then be build as follows:

soapcpp2 -c ssl.h
gcc -DWITH_OPENSSL -o sslclient sslclient.c stdsoap2.c soapC.c soapClient.c -lssl -lcrypto
gcc -DWITH_OPENSSL -o sslserver sslserver.c stdsoap2.c soapC.c soapServer.c -lssl -lcrypto -lpthread

Disclaimer: We cannot guarantee that all client examples can connect to third
party Web services when these services are down or have been removed.

For Windows users, the archive includes a samples directory, see README.txt
