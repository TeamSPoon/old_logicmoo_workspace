GoDiS Manual
Staffan Larsson

This manual is a work in progress.

1. INTRODUCTION

This document is intended as a manual for depeloping applications for
GoDiS, an Issue-based dialogue system. For an explanation of the
issue-based theory and its implementation in GoDiS, see Larsson
(2002).

2. INSTALLATION

This section describes the steps necessary to download and install
GoDiS and TrindiKit, the toolkit on which GoDiS is built.

2.1 Downloading and installing TrindiKit

TrindiKit can be accessed either via the TrindiKit webpage
(http://www.ling.gu.se/projekt/trindi//trindikit/), via the TrindiKit
SourceForge website (http://sourceforge.net/projects/trindikit/), or
via anonymous CVS from sourceforge. The latter is prefereable if you
want to get the absolutely latest version; however, the documentation
is not always up to date and some parts of the toolkit may be
incomplete. If you want a well-documented release, the first two
options are preferable.




2.1.1 Accessing TrindiKit via anonymous CVS

To checkout a read-only version of TrindiKit from the SourceForge CVS
repository, do the following.

* UNIX/LINUX

cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.trindikit.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/trindikit login  
[supply no password if prompted]
cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.trindikit.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/trindikit checkout trindikit

* Windows

Unless you have already done so, download and install a CVS client; we
prefer TortoiseCVS available at

	 http://www.tortoisecvs.org/



2.2   Downloading and installing GoDiS

GoDiS currently has no webpage and is only available via anonymous CVS.

3     Getting started

3.1   Running an existing GoDiS application

3.3   Copying and modifying an existing GoDiS application

A good way to get started on your own application is to copy an
existing application directory and successively replacing the
application components.
