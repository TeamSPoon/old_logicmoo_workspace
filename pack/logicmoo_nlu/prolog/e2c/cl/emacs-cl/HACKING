Random hacking hints:

To run the tests:
  make check
or
  (load "tests.lisp")

Running GCL's ANSI tests:
  "rm contrib/gcl-ansi-tests/*.elc" if you have reason to suspect
  previously compiled files were generated by a buggy compiler.

  (setq
    *default-pathname-defaults*
    (pathname "/home/lars/src/emacs-cl/contrib/gcl-ansi-tests/")
    *print-length* 100
    *compile-verbose* t
    *load-verbose* t)
  (load "gclload.lsp")

  Run the tests: (in-package :cl-test) (do-tests)

Loading load-cl.el (or any other file) twice may well not work.
Individual functions can usually be redefined (with M-C-x or similar),
but to reload the whole system, restart Emacs and load load-cl.el.

To see the Emacs Lisp code generated by the compiler:
  (el:|compile2| (... Common Lisp code ...))
