To load the files, load load-cl.el into Emacs.  Warning: Loading the
last file, populate.el, will take a long time, especially on slow
computers.

It's important to compile the files for improved speed.  To do this,
type "M-x compile-cl".  A Makefile is also included, so you can just
type "make" at a shell.

The code is frequently verified to work with GNU Emacs 20.7 and 21.3,
and XEmacs 21.4.

To start an interactive session, type "M-x emacs-cl".

With the "emacs-cl" script, it's also possible to run Emacs Common
Lisp in batch mode.
