Here we go!

What is Closette?

This answer is taken from the source file:
;;; Closette is an implementation of a subset of CLOS with a metaobject
;;; protocol as described in "The Art of The Metaobject Protocol",
;;; MIT Press, 1991.

Since Closette is a subset of CLOS there are several restrictions. The
following were found by chance:

1. It is not possible to redefine a class
2. DEFGENERIC does not know the :method option (this happens very
   early when loading the gcl-ansi-tests)
Probably lots more ...

The current version of Emacs Common Lisp must be slightly modified to
run with Closette. PRINT-OBJECT should be a generic function but is
defined as a normal function in emacs-cl. At the time PRINT-OBJECT is
defined in Closette, there is at least one call to REMOVE-IF-NOT which
calles REMOVE-IF with the COMPLEMENTed function, but the latter uses
PRINT-OBJECT and this leads to an endless recursion. So COMPLEMENT
must be redefined without the use of PRINT-OBJECT.

To use Closette 

  (load "closette.lisp")
  (use-package :closette)

should be sufficient. There is a hint in the source file that one
should not try to compile Closette. I don't know why and I did not
try.

The tests within closette-tests.lisp should not be taken too
literally. It is not a real test suite but a collection of definitions
where the expected results are added as comments. These are sometimes
wrong. Comparing the outputs of emacs-cl and CLisp running those tests
showed essentially one difference (line 744) and CLisp seems to be
right there.

I would finish this with "Have fun", but Closette is very slow under
emacs-cl, so it is actually a GREAT fun if you are only masochistic
enough.
