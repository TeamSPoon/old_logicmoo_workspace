Relevant to dialogue applications: compile the files defined by the
{\tt dialogue\_\-files} config file entry. These should at a minimum
define the predicates {\tt lf\_\-to\_\-dialogue\_\-move}, {\tt
initial\_\-dialogue\_\-state}, {\tt update\_\-dialogue\_\-state} and {\tt
abstract\_\-action\_\-to\_\-action} with appropriate arities.
