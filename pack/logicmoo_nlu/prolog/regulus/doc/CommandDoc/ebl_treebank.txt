Parse all sentences in current EBL training set, defined by the {\tt
ebl\_\-corpus} config file entry, to create a treebank file. Sentences that
fail to parse are printed out with warning messages, and a summary
statistic is produced at the end of the run. This is very useful for
checking where you are with coverage.
