Put the top-loop in a mode where it shows the results of doing
EBL-based processing on input sentences. For this to make sense,
you need to have loaded a general grammar and have a config file
entry for {\tt ebl\_\-operationality}.

When the top loop is in EBL mode, input sentences are parsed
and then subjected to EBL generalisation, using the rules in
{\tt ebl\_\-operationality}. The file is reloaded each time.
The learned rules are printed in schematic form, as they
are in the files output by the {EBL\_\-POSTPROCESS} and
related commands. Each rule is paired with the phrase used
to induce it.
