Update the translation judgements file, defined by the
translation\_\-corpus\_\-judgements config file entry, from the output
of the speech translation corpus output file, defined by the
translation\_\-speech\_\-corpus\_\-results config file entry. This
command should be used after editing the CSV version of the output
file produced by the TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS or
TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS\_\-AGAIN command. Editing should replace
question marks in the first column by valid judgements, currently
'good', 'ok' or 'bad'.
