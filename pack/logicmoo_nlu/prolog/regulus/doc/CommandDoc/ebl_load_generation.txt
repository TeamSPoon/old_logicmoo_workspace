Compile and load the current specialised generation grammar. This will
be the file {\tt $\langle$prefix$\rangle$\_\-specialised\_\-no\_\-binarise\_\-default.regulus},
where {\tt $\langle$prefix$\rangle$} is the value of the config file
entry {\tt working\_\-file\_\-prefix}. The resulting compiled
generation grammar is placed in the file defined by the {\tt
generation\_\-rules} config file entry.

Note that {\tt EBL\_\-LOAD\_\-GENERATION} places the compiled
generation grammar in the same place as LOAD\_\-GENERATION.
