Relevant to translation applications. If output speech is to be
produced using recorded wavfiles, points to an automatically created
file that holds a script which can be used to create the missing
wavfiles. This script is produced by finding all the lexical items in
the file referenced by generation\_\-rules, and creating an entry for
every item not already in wavfile\_\-directory. The file is created as
part of the processing carried out by the LOAD\_\-TRANSLATE command.

Due to limitations of some operating systems the script contains some latin-1 characters translated to character sequences shown in the table below.
