Process speech mode translation corpus, defined by the
translation\_\-speech\_\-corpus config file entry. The output file, defined
by the translation\_\-speech\_\-corpus\_\-results config file entry, contains
question marks for translations that have not yet been judged. If
these are replaced by valid judgements, currently 'good', 'ok' or
'bad', the new judgements can be incorporated into the stored
translation judgements file using the command
UPDATE\_\-TRANSLATION\_\-JUDGEMENTS\_\-SPEECH. A second output file, defined by
the translation\_\-corpus\_\-tmp\_\-recognition\_\-judgements config file entry,
contains "blank" recognition judgements: here, the question marks
should be replaced with either 'y' (acceptable recognition), or 'n'
(unacceptable recognition). Recognition judgements can be updated
using the UPDATE\_\-RECOGNITION\_\-JUDGEMENTS command.
