Relevant to bidirectional translation applications: switches on a mode where input can be passed to either side of the bidirectional system. Commands for the ``question'' side are prefaced with ``Q:'', e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
Q: LOAD_TRANSLATE

Q: where is the pain
\end{verbatim}
while commands for the `answer'' side are prefaced with ``A:'', e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
A: EBL_LOAD

Q: en la cabeza
\end{verbatim}
