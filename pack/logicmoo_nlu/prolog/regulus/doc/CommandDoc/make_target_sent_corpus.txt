Relevant to translation applications. Take the results held in the
file indicated by {\tt translation\_\-corpus\_\-results} and turn them
into a sent-formatted file. Put the result in the file indicated by
{\tt target\_\-sent\_\-corpus}. Thus, for example, the call
\begin{verbatim}
MAKE_TARGET_SENT_CORPUS .MAIN
\end{verbatim}
will create a file where, for each translation {\tt $\langle$Sent$\rangle$}
in {\tt translation\_\-corpus\_\-results}, the file {\tt target\_\-sent\_\-corpus}
will contain a record of the form
\begin{verbatim}
sent(<Sent>).
\end{verbatim}
