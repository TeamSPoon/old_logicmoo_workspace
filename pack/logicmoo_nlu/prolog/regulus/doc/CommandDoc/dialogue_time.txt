In dialogue processing applications where expressions like ``today''
or ``next week'' are used, it is necessary to know the current
time. When doing regression testing, it is then useful to be able to
set a notional time, so that responses to time-dependent utterances
stay stable.

The {\tt DIALOGUE\_\-TIME} command makes it possible to print the
notional time from the command-line. The notional time can also be
retrieved using the predicate {\tt get\_\-notional\_\-time/1} in {\tt
PrologLib/utilities.pl}.
