Relevant to translation applications. Points to a file of examples
used as input to the parameterised command TRANSLATE\_\-CORPUS
$\langle$Arg$\rangle$. The format is sent(Atom), so for example a
typical line would be
\begin{verbatim}
sent('switch off the light').
\end{verbatim}
(note the closing period).
