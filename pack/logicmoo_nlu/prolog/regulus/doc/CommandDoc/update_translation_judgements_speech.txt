Update the translation judgements file, defined by the
translation\_\-corpus\_\-judgements config file entry, from the output of
the speech translation corpus output file, defined by the
translation\_\-speech\_\-corpus\_\-results config file entry. This command
should be used after editing the output file produced by the
TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS or TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS\_\-AGAIN
command. Editing should replace question marks by valid judgements,
currently 'good', 'ok' or 'bad'.
