Process the default dialogue mode development corpus, defined by the
dialogue\_\-corpus config file entry. The output file, defined by the
dialogue\_\-corpus\_\-results config file entry, contains question marks for
dialogue processing steps that have not yet been judged. If these are
replaced by valid judgements, currently 'good', or 'bad', the new
judgements can be incorporated into the dialogue judgements file
(defined by the dialogue\_\-corpus\_\-judgements config file entry) using
the command UPDATE\_\-DIALOGUE\_\-JUDGEMENTS.
