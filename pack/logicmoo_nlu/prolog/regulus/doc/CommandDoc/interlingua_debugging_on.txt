Switch on interlingua debugging; relevant to translation applications
that use an interlingua checking grammar. In this mode, translations
that give rise to interlingua that is ill-formed according to the 
interlingua checking grammar are processed by subjecting the ill-formed
interlingua to all possible insertions, deletions and substitutions of 
a single interlingua element, until either a well-formed variant is
discovered or a timeout is exceeded. The first well-formed variant
found is displayed.
