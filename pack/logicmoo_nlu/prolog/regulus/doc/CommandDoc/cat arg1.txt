When doing grammar development, this command lets you display the list of features associated with a given syntactic category. It requires a grammar to be loaded. Here is an example with the English grammar:
\begin{verbatim}

Features for category "np": [agr,case,conj,def,gapsin,gapsout,
nform,pronoun,sem,sem_n_type,takes_attrib_pp,takes_frequency_pp,
takes_loc_pp,takes_partitive,takes_post_mods,takes_to_pp,
takes_with_pp,wh]
\end{verbatim}
