Update the translation judgements file,  defined by the translation\_\-corpus\_\-judgements config file entry, from the output of the default text translation corpus output file, defined by the translation\_\-corpus\_\-results config file entry. This command should be used after editing the output file produced by the TRANSLATE\_\-CORPUS command. Editing should replace question marks by valid judgements, currently 'good', 'ok' or 'bad'.
