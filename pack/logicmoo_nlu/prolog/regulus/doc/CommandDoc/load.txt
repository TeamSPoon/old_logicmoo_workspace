Compile and load the Regulus grammar defined by the {\tt
regulus\_\-grammar} config file entry in DCG and left-corner form. If
the grammar files and the config file have not been modified since the
last invocation of the {\tt LOAD} command, left-corner compilation is
not performed, and the stored version of the compiled grammar is used.

If parse preferences and/or nbest preference files are defined, these
are also loaded. These files are specified by the parameters {\tt
parse\_\-preferences} and {\tt nbest\_\-preferences} respectively, and
can be also loaded using the {\tt LOAD\_\-PREFERENCES} command.
