Search the parsing history file created by the {\tt EBL\_\-MAKE\_\-TREEBANK}
command to find matching example. The argument is treated as a list of
words, which may optionally contain wildcards, and matching is performed
at the word (opposed to character) level. Each matching example is printed 
together with a date-stamp showing when it last produced a parse.
Here is a typical invocation:
\begin{verbatim}
>> PARSE_HISTORY i would * cheese
(Show parse history for examples matching specified string)
