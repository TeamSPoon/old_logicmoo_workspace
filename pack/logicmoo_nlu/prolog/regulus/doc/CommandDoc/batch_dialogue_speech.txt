Speech mode version of BATCH\_\-DIALOGUE. Process the default dialogue
mode speech corpus, defined by the dialogue\_\-speech\_\-corpus config file
entry. The output file, defined by the dialogue\_\-speechcorpus\_\-results
config file entry, contains question marks for dialogue processing
steps that have not yet been judged. If these are replaced by valid
judgements, currently 'good', or 'bad', the new judgements can be
incorporated into the dialogue judgements file (defined by the
dialogue\_\-corpus\_\-judgements config file entry) using the command
UPDATE\_\-DIALOGUE\_\-JUDGEMENTS\_\-SPEECH.
