Command used for regression testing in speech translation
applications, when employing a paraphrase file
(cf. Section~\ref{Section:TranslationRegressionParaphrases}). 
There will typically be some out-of-coverage utterances which are
still close enough that they will successfully go through speech
understanding. However, since the transcription is out-of-coverage,
the scoring routines will have no way to know that the result
is incorrect, since the transcription produces no reference 
output to compare with.

Under these circumstances, it is possible to declare a {\em paraphrase
file}, which associates in-coverage sentences with out-of-coverage
transcriptions. A paraphrase file record has the following format:
\begin{verbatim}
paraphrase(<TranscriptAtom>, <ParaphraseAtom>)
\end{verbatim}
where \verb!<TranscriptAtom>! is the transcription and \verb!<ParaphraseAtom>!
is the paraphrase.

The command {\tt CHECK\_\-PARAPHRASES} assumes that a grammar is loaded.
It parses the \verb!<ParaphraseAtom>! fields in the paraphrase file, and
checks that they are all in coverage, issuing warnings for the ones that are not.
