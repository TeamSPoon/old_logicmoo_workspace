Process the default text mode translation corpus, defined by the
translation\_\-corpus config file entry. The output file, defined by
the translation\_\-corpus\_\-results config file entry, contains
question marks for translations that have not yet been judged. If
these are replaced by valid judgements, currently 'good', 'ok' or
'bad', the new judgements can be incorporated into the translation
judgements file (defined by the translation\_\-corpus\_\-judgements
config file entry) using the command
UPDATE\_\-TRANSLATION\_\-JUDGEMENTS.
