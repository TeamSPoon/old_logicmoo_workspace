Compile and load the current generation grammar, defined by the
{\tt generation\_\-grammar} config file entry. The resulting compiled
generation grammar is placed in the file defined by the
{\tt generation\_\-grammar($\langle$Arg$\rangle$)} config file entry. This can
be useful if you are normally using grammar specialisation to build
the generation grammar.
