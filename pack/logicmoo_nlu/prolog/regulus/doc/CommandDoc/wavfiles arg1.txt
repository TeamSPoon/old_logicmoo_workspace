Show the last $\langle$Arg$\rangle$ wavfiles recorded using
recognition from the top-level (the RECOGNISE command). Each file is
displayed together with a timestamp and associated text. The
associated text is a transcription if one is available, or the
recognition result otherwise.

The files shown by this command can be used as top-level 
recorded speech input by typing
\begin{verbatim}
WAVFILE <Wavfile>
\end{verbatim}
e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
WAVFILE c:/Regulus/recorded_wavfiles/2008-04-24_22-36-03/utt05.wav
\end{verbatim}
