Parameterised version of TRANSLATE\_\-CORPUS. Process the text mode
translation corpus with ID $\langle$Arg$\rangle$, defined by the
parameterised config file entry
translation\_\-corpus($\langle$Arg$\rangle$). The output file, defined
by the parameterised config file entry
translation\_\-corpus\_\-results($\langle$Arg$\rangle$), contains
question marks for translations that have not yet been judged. If
these are replaced by valid judgements, currently 'good', 'ok' or
'bad', the new judgements can be incorporated into the translation
judgements file (defined by the translation\_\-corpus\_\-judgements
config file entry) using the parameterised command
UPDATE\_\-TRANSLATION\_\-JUDGEMENTS $\langle$Arg$\rangle$.
