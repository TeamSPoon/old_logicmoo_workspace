Do translation through interlingua, i.e.\ by first applying
source-to-interlingua rules (from the file that {\tt
to\_\-interlingua\_\-rules} points to) and then interlingua-to-target
rules ((from the file that {\tt from\_\-interlingua\_\-rules} points
to). This applies both to interactive processing in translate mode,
and to batch processing using commands like {\tt TRANSLATE\_\-CORPUS},
{\tt TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS} and {\tt
TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS\_\-AGAIN}.
