In dialogue processing applications where words like ``I'' and ``me''
are used, it can be important to know the identity of the speaker; for
example, in the Calendar application, one could say ``When is my next
meeting?'' or ``Am I attending a meeting on Friday?'' When doing
regression testing, it is then useful to be able to set a notional
speaker, so that responses to time-dependent utterances stay stable.

The {\tt SET\_\-NOTIONAL\_\-SPEAKER} command makes it possible to set the identity 
of the notional speaker from the command-line. The argument should be an atom, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
SET_NOTIONAL_SPEAKER manny
\end{verbatim}
The notional speaker can be retrieved using the predicate 
{\tt get\_\-notional\_\-time/1} in {\tt PrologLib/utilities.pl}.
