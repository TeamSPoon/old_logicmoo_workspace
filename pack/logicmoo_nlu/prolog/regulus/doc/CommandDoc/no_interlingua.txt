Applies to translation applications: converse of the command {\tt
INTERLINGUA}, it sets the translation processing mode to perform
direct translation from source to target, i.e.\ not through the
interlingua. It follows that the current config file must define a
value for the parameter {\tt transfer\_\-rules}, which should point to
a file of direct translation rules.

This applies both to interactive processing when the TRANSLATE command
is in effect, and to batch processing using commands like
{\tt TRANSLATE\_\-CORPUS}, {\tt TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS} and
{\tt TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS\_\-AGAIN}.
