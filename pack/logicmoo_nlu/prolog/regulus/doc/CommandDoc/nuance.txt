Compile current Regulus grammar into Nuance GSL form. You won't be
able to use this command in conjunction with a large general grammar,
since it currently runs out of memory during compilation --- this why
we need EBL. The {\tt NUANCE} command is useful for smaller Regulus
grammars, e.g. the Toy1 grammar.

The current Regulus grammar is defined by the {\tt regulus\_\-grammar}
config file entry, and the location of the generated Nuance grammar by
the {\tt nuance\_\-grammar} config file entry.
