Load all translation-related files defined in the currently valid
config file. These consist of a subset of the following; the set of
files required depends on whether translation is interlingua-based or
direct, and whether translation is from source to target, from source
to interlingua, or from interlingua to target.

\begin{itemize} 

\item An interlingua checking grammar compiled into generation form,
defined by the {\tt interlingua\_\-structure} config file
entry. Required if translation is interlingua-based.

item An interlingua declarations file defined by the
{\tt interlingua\_\-declarations} config file entry. Required
if translation is interlingua-based.

\item One or more to\_\-interlingua rules files defined by the {\tt
to\_\-interlingua\_\-rules} config file entry. Required if
translation is interlingua-based.

\item One or more from\_\-interlingua rules files defined by the {\tt
from\_\-interlingua\_\-rules} config file entry.  Required if
translation is interlingua-based.

\item An ellipsis classes file (optional) defined by the
{\tt ellipsis\_\-classes} config file entry. If this is defined, you need to
compile it first using the {\tt COMPILE\_\-ELLIPSIS\_\-PATTERNS} command.

\item A generation grammar file (required, unless translation is from
source to interlingua) defined by the {\tt generation\_\-rules} config
file entry. This should be the compiled form of a Regulus grammar for
the target language. The compiled generation grammar must first be
created using the {\tt LOAD\_\-GENERATION} command.

\item A generation preferences file (optional) defined by the
{\tt generation\_\-preferences} config file entry.

\item A collocations file (optional) defined by the
{\tt collocation\_\-rules} config file entry.

\item An orthography rules file (optional) defined by the
{\tt orthography\_\-rules} config file entry.  

\item One or more transfer rules files defined by the
{\tt transfer\_\-rules} config file entry. This is only
required for direct (i.e.\ non-interlingua-based) translation
applications.
 
\end{itemize}

If the config file entries {\tt wavfile\_\-directory} and
{\tt wavfile\_\-recording\_\-script} are defined, implying that output
speech will be produced using recorded wavfiles, this command also
produces a new version of the file defined by
{\tt wavfile\_\-recording\_\-script}.
