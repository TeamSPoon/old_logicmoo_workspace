In dialogue processing applications where expressions like ``today''
or ``next week'' are used, it is necessary to know the current
time. When doing regression testing, it is then useful to be able to
set a notional time, so that responses to time-dependent utterances
stay stable.

The {\tt SET\_\-NOTIONAL\_\-TIME} command makes it possible to set the identity 
of the notional time from the command-line. The format is 
YYYY-MM-DD\_HH-MM-SS, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
SET_NOTIONAL_TIME 2010-08-04_15-17-55
\end{verbatim}
The notional time can be retrieved using the predicate 
{\tt get\_\-notional\_\-time/1} in {\tt PrologLib/utilities.pl}.
