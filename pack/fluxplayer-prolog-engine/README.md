# fluxplayer-prolog-engine
Working to get Fluxplayer prolog working for gdl-perf.

This is going to take some work to write an executable that the gdl-perf framework can invoke.

This requires ECLiPSe 5.10 to be installed.

Once that's done, run make to generate the /bin directory and output. This will likely be machine-dependent, so this isn't checked in.
