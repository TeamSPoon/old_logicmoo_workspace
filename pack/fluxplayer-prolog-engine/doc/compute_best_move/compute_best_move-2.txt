Description
compute_best_move/2 should search the game tree and store the best move in the current state with set_current_best_move/1. Subsequent calls to set_current_best_move/1 will overwrite the previously stored move. compute_best_move/2 will be stopped when the time runs out. The last move stored with set_current_best_move/1 will then be send to the game master.
