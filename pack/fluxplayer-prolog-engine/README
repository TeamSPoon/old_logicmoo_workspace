The general game playing (GGP) starter code is a basic general game playing system (see http://www.general-game-playing.de for explanations) that only plays legal moves. It can be easily extended with an own strategy.


Software requirements:
----------------------
ECLiPSe prolog 5.10 or higher (http://www.eclipse-clp.org/)


Installation:
-------------
Adjust paths to the ECLiPSe executable in "Makefile" and "start_game_player.sh" to your local installation of ECLiPSe.
Call "make" if you changed the source code and want to run the program from the command line.


Running the program:
--------------------
From the command line call "start_game_player.sh" or "make run".
From within ECLiPSe or the tkECLiPSe interface consult "src/main.ecl" and use "main:start_game_player" as query.
Use the predicates in "src/debug_player.ecl" for easier debugging.


Documentation:
--------------
Documentation for some of the prolog modules can be found at doc/index.html


Implementing a strategy:
------------------------
Change the compute_best_move/2 predicate in "src/compute_best_move.ecl".


prolog/
 is the YAP/SWI prolog port (in progress)
