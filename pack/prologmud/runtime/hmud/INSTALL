Installation - Quick guide
==========================

- I'm assuming you're running Linux (but it might work on any Unix environment).
- You should have Perl installed in order to run the Flash policy server.

1 - Flash Policy Server
-----------------------

First, you MUST set up a Flash policy server in order to make the Flash
plugin connect to your MUD server. Since it uses Flash (and its sockets lib)
hMUD WILL NOT connect if you do not have the policy server running and properly
configured.

Fortunately, there's already a policy server bundled with hMUD. I got this one
from:

    http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/socket_policy_files.html

It's already distributed within hMUD and it's simple to use. From the hMUD root
folder, just run:

    ./policyd

Ok, now it should be listening the port 4010 and ready to authorize Flash to
connect from any website running the client to any port of your MUD server.

2 - Configuring hMUD
--------------------

    - Edit config.js
    - Change the host entry to your MUD hostname or IP number
    - Change the port entry to the port number in which your MUD is running

3 - Run the client!
-------------------

Ok, there's more to do probably. But that's the minimal configuration necessary
to make hMUD work and access your MUD.

Let's assume you installed hMUD in <yourmudname.com/hmud/>, from a web browser
like Firefox, Google Chrome or IE7 (please, not Lynx...) access this link:

    http://yourmudname.com/hmud/hmud.html

IT SHOULD WORK INSTANTLY!

And that's all, hMUD should be running right now.

4 - Messages in your language
-----------------------------

If you want hMUD in English, just run this command:

    cp messages.en.js messages.js

hMUD uses the messages in message.js to display messages. If you want to see
hMUD in other languages, please, just translate messages.js to your language
and reload hMUD in your browser. Clear the browser cache if that doesn't work!
