These bench scrips can be used to invoke different bench suites for
different emulators.  Benching information is emitted as Prolog facts
of the form:

datum(Label,Value)

where label denotes information abt the test being run and value is
the result.  Currently, benching scripts should be called in one of
two ways.

1) quick_bench.sh where
	argument 1 is the directory in shich the benches are to be found
	argument 2 is the script to call in that directory
	argument 3 is the emulator
	argument 4 is the (Prolog) file into which results are to be written.

Example; 

sh quick_bench.sh prolog_benches test.sh /home/tswift/XSB/XSB/XSB/bin/xsb
pbench_sharing.P

2) precise_bench.sh whose arguments are the same as above.  This bench
tests out various memory configurations.  When done, it writes to the
screen the minimal time and the variance for each test.
