This is a set of tests for the XSB system.

testsuite.sh XSB-INSTALL-DIR

    Runs all tests for a given configuration.
    XSB-INSTALL-DIR is the full path for the XSB installation directory.
    For the complete list of options, see the header of testsuite.sh

    The testsuite script creates a file in the /tmp dir
    (/tmp/xsb_test_log.$USER) with the log of the run. In case any test
    fails, the script will automatically notify the user who started it.

    Can take options, like -exclude <test-list> and -only <test-list>
    See the header of testsuite.sh for more details

supertest.sh XSB-INSTALL-DIR

	     Configures XSB with several different parameters and then runs
	     the test suite using each.

gctest.sh XSB-INSTALL-DIR

    Like supertest.sh, but specifically tests garbage collector.
