TODO:

- Simple and intuitive log saving in html (well, flash is boring, it does not
  let me call FileReference.save() through ExternalInterface, I'm thinking in
  some solutions but it will take more time than I expected).
- beep
- clear character sequence (sent from MUD)
- better telnet parsing
- better modularization
- Multiple commands separated by ';' (or maybe a multiline textarea when doing SHIFT+ENTER)
- Implement a better way of knowing when the server is asking for password,
  instead os relying on Telnet echo commands. So that, even when echo is off on
  the client side the commands will still be added to the history normally.
  Only sensitive data (password) would be treated differently.
  Suggestions:
    - create an option echoOnByServerIsPassword (true or false)
      so that servers that use echo for other things will have it disabled.
    - create option passwordRegexp = /^Password:/ that will check
      when the server asks for password and swap the command line with
      a password input field.
