Suits -
characters are wearing a uniform. 'Suits' go over the uniform. They can be worn and taken off.

if the char is in a vacuum and is not wearing a suit or their visor is up they get 'your blood is boiling' message for one turn, then die.

when the visor is down the char is breathing from their air tank, whose pressure goes down 1 each turn. if the pressure reaches zero the character will get 'you cant breath' messages for next 3 turns, then die

There is a current tank. If the char has only one tank it's current, if not, then whichever was current last frame is current.


When worn, these verbs are added:
check air (or just 'air') - reports number of turns of air left
visor up
visor down
change tank - if the char has more than one tank in their inventory, the fullest one is exchanged for the current one.
