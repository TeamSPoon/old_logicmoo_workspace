---+ ClioPatria Application configuration

This directory was automatically created by the ClioPatria setup script.
It  can  be  filled  with  Prolog    source-files  that  configure  your
application for your specific needs. ClioPatria contains several example
config files, which are located in the directory:

    /mnt/dddd/workspace/phase02-jrtl/PrologMUD/pack/ClioPatria/config-available

For example, to enhance the system setup   for development, you may wish
to do:

    ==
    ln -s /mnt/dddd/workspace/phase02-jrtl/PrologMUD/pack/ClioPatria/config-available/debug.pl
    ==

This application may  provide   additional  application-specific example
configuration files.
