The MUD_PDDL repository is now both Planning and NLU/NLG code.. The NLTK of Prolog!



It is very bothersome that with all the cool NLU demos out there there is  that is like GATE or even a Blackboard system 


This NLU/NLG ToolKit uses the following projects into a usable pipeline

Extended Information State Modelling  -- Stina Ericsson, 19th January, 2006

The Attempto Parsing Engine (APE) translates ACE texts unambiguously into discourse representation structures (DRS) that use a variant of the language of first-order logic.[2] A DRS can be further translated into other formal languages, for instance AceRules with various semantics,[3] OWL,[4] and SWRL. Translating an ACE text into (a fragment of) first-order logic allows users to reason about the text, for instance to verify, to validate, and to query it.
