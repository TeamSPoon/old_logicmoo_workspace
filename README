Extended Information State Modelling  -- Stina Ericsson, 19th January, 2006

The Attempto Parsing Engine (APE) translates ACE texts unambiguously into discourse representation structures (DRS) that use a variant of the language of first-order logic.[2] A DRS can be further translated into other formal languages, for instance AceRules with various semantics,[3] OWL,[4] and SWRL. Translating an ACE text into (a fragment of) first-order logic allows users to reason about the text, for instance to verify, to validate, and to query it.
