			INSTALLING MOTEL
			================

The MOTEL distribution contains one compressed tar file, which
includes the MOTEL system. To install the sytem execute the following 
steps:

1. Uncompress the compressed tar file

prompt(1)% uncompress motel.tar.Z

2. Extract the source file and documentation file from the tar file

prompt(2)% tar xvf motel.tar

This results in the files 	
README      ---	brief description how the system can be used
int.c       --- Part of the interface between Lucid Common Lisp and Sicstus Prolog
int.o       --- Part of the interface between Lucid Common Lisp and Sicstus Prolog
int.pl	    --- Prolog code of the interface between Lucid Common Lisp and Sicstus Prolog
motel.lisp  ---	Lisp   code of the interface between Lucid Common Lisp and Sicstus Prolog
motel.pl    ---	MOTEL source code	
motel.dvi   --- MOTEL user manual 
nh.dvi      --- Introduction to modal terminological logics

After starting your PROLOG system you have to consult the source file.

prompt(3)% sicstus
SICStus 2.1 #5: Tue Jul 21 16:16:49 MET DST 1992
| ?- consult(motel).
consulting motel.pl...
motel.pl consulted, 5600 msec 329168 bytes

yes
| ?-

Now you can work with the MOTEL system as described in the user manual.

To use the interface between Lucid Common Lisp and SICStus Prolog, you 
have to modify the file motel.lisp. At the beginning it contains two
setq-commands:

(setq *consult-motel-string* "['/usr/local/motel/motel.pl'].")
(setq *prolog-executable* "/usr/local/sicstus2.1/sicstus")
(setq *int_dot_pl* "/HG/hiwis/timm/lucid/int.pl")

You should replace `/usr/local/motel/motel.pl` with the filename
of your installation of the motel.pl file. Furthermore you should
replace `/usr/local/sicstus2.1/sicstus` with the filename of you
PROLOG system. The variable `*int_dot_pl*` contains the location 
of the file `int.pl` included in the distribution

Now you can load this file after you have started Lucid Common Lisp:

prompt(4)% lucid
;;; Lucid Common Lisp/SPARC
;;; Application Environment Version 4.0.0, 6 July 1990
;;; Copyright (C) 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 by Lucid, Inc.

> (load "motel.lisp")
;;; Loading source file "motel.lisp"
;;; Warning: File "motel.lisp" does not begin with IN-PACKAGE.
    Loading into package "USER"
#P"/usr/local/motel/src/motel/motel.lisp"
> 

Then you are able to work with the interface between Lucid Lisp and
SICSTUS Prolog as described the appendix of the MOTEL user manual.
