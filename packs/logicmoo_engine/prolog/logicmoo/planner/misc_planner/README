This contains two representations and 4 planners for the deliver robot domain.

delrob_strips.pl  is the delivery robot world in the STRIPS representation
delrob_sitc.pl    is the delivery robot world in the Situation Calculus

bprove.pl         is a depth bounded meta-interpreter suitable for planning
                  using the situation calculus representation
strips_strips.pl  is a STRIPS planner that uses the STRIPS representation
regr_strips.pl    is a regression planner that uses the STRIPS representation
pop.pl            is a parial order planner that uses the STRIPS representation
