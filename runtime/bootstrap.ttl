In the context of the OpenRobotOntology, doers of an action are as a matter of fact instances to Agent_PartiallyTangible (q.v.), even if they may not be in a broader context (e.g. a falling rock that dents a car's roof). Depending upon the context, doers of actions might be animate or inanimate, conscious or nonconscious.

Negative example include situations, events, abstract objects, and regions of space that exclusively act as possible locations for other spatial objects (see SpaceRegion). An important specialization of EnduringThing_Localized is Place (q.v.). The salient distinction between places (instances of Place) and locations (instances of EnduringThing_Localized) is that places are assumed to have relatively permanent locations, whereas locations need not have permanent locations. Thus, from the perspective of someone standing on a beach, the crest of a breaking wave can be a location at which foaming is occuring (thus an EnduringThing_Localized), but it cannot be such a place (i.e. it cannot be an instance of Place).".

Second, although we do insist on location relative to another spatial thing or in some embedding space, a SpatialThing might or might not be located in the actual physical universe. It is far from clear that all SpatialThings are so located: an ideal platonic circle or a trajectory through the phase space of some physical system (e.g.) might not be.
