This is based on the if-then sentences
in Appendix A
in "Further Notes. Draft of December 19, 2007"
by Juri Luca De Coi.

The idea has been to convert Juri's if-then sentences into every-sentences
to see if they come out more readable than the if-then sentences,
and also to test the Core ACE paraphraser which would translate the
every-sentences back into if-then sentences. This way we will have 3 sets
of sentences: Juri's original sentences, Kaarel's "everyfication",
DRACE Core's paraphrases. We should make sure that APE really converts them
into equivalent DRSs. We should also make sure that Protune users
accept those 3 sets as equivalent.

Note: the sentences below can be parsed with guessing on.
On 2007-12-30, the roundtrip ACE1->DRS->ACE2->DRS worked, where
ACE1 is this file,
DRS is its DRS-translation,
ACE2 is the Core ACE paraphrase of ACE1, and
DRS (i.e. the same DRS as before) is its DRS-translation.
