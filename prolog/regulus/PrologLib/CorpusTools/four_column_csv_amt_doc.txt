DOCUMENTATION FOR USING THE SCRIPTS TO DO AMT JUDGING OF COMPARATIVE TRANSLATIONS

The idea is to use the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) to support judge
the contrasting quality of pairs of translations.

The intended scenario is that we have a set of source sentences, each
of which is translated by a baseline system, and then by a number of
other systems, each identified by a label. At the moment, these labels
are most likely to correspond to pre-processing rules.

The input is presented as a four-column tab-separated UTF-8 CSV file, whose format is

<Source>  <BaselineTrans>  <VariantTrans> <Label>
 
There are two scripts. The first takes the input file and produces
another CSV file, which can be used as input to the AMT task. When the
task has run, you download the result file (also CSV) and run the
second script to get the final results

--------------------------------------

RUNNING THE FIRST SCRIPT (PRODUCING AMT INPUT)

Invoke as follows:

sicstus -l four_column_csv_to_amt_input.pl -a <CSVFile> <NumberOfLinesInHIT>

where 

<CSVFile> is the CSV file you want to process 
<NumberOfLinesInHIT> is the number of items in the HITs you will produce.

The name of the output AMT file will be of the form 

<CSVFile>_<Label>_randomised_spreadsheet.csv.

The lines from the original file will be presented in random order,
and the order of <BaselineTrans> <VariantTrans> will be randomised
within each line.

Example:

sicstus -l four_column_csv_to_amt_input.pl -a $ACCEPT/MT/Evaluations/combined_RSource_RTrans_PrEdTrans.csv 50

--------------------------------------

RUNNING THE SECOND SCRIPT (INTREPRETING THE AMT OUTPUT)

Invoke as follows:

sicstus -l four_column_csv_and_amt_output_to_results.pl -a <CSVFile> 

where <CSVFile> is the original four-column CSV file you want to process 

This assumes that the AMT results file name is of the form <CSVFile>_amt.csv

The name of the summary files will be of the form
<CSVFile>_<Label>_results.csv, one for each <Label> in the input data

Example:

sicstus -l four_column_csv_and_amt_output_to_results.pl -a $ACCEPT/MT/Evaluations/combined_RSource_RTrans_PrEdTrans.csv
