Process speech mode translation corpus, starting from the results
saved from the most recent invocation of the TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS
command. This is useful if you are testing speech translation
performance, but have only changed the translation or generation
files. The output files are the same as for the
TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS command.
