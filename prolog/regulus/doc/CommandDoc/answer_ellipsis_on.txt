In bidirectional translation applications, it is possible to use ``answer ellipsis'': one user asks a question, and non-sentential responses are treated as ellipsis. For example, in an English-to-French translator, the question ``Where is the pain?'' might be translated as ``Où avez-vous mal?'' Then, if answer ellipsis is switched on and there are suitable ellipsis declarations loaded, ``le soir'' might be interpreted as ``J'ai mal le soir''.
