Splits the speech translation corpus output file, defined by the {\tt
translation\_\-speech\_\-corpus} config file entry, into 
\begin{itemize} 
\item an in-coverage part defined by a {\tt
translation\_\-speech\_\-corpus($\langle$Arg2$\rangle$)}
config file entry, and

\item an out-of-coverage part defined by a {\tt
translation\_\-speech\_\-corpus($\langle$Arg3$\rangle$)}
config file entry.  
\end{itemize}
Coverage is with respect to the top-level grammar {\tt
$\langle$Arg1$\rangle$}, which must be loaded.

Typical call: 
\begin{verbatim}
SPLIT_SPEECH_CORPUS .MAIN in_coverage out_of_coverage
\end{verbatim}
