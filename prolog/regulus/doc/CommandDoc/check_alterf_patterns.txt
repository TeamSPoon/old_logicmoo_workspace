Check the consistency of the current Alterf patterns file, defined by
the {\tt alterf\_\-patterns\_\-file config} file entry. Records in the
file should have the format
\begin{verbatim}
alterf_pattern(<Pattern>, <Atom>, <Sent>).
\end{verbatim}
or
\begin{verbatim}
alterf_pattern(<Pattern>, <Atom>, <Sent>) :- <Conds>.
\end{verbatim}
where \verb!<Pattern>! is the Alterf pattern, \verb!<Atom>! is the semantic
atom it corresponds to, \verb!<Sent>! is an example sentence illustrating
the patterns, and \verb!<Conds>! are optional Prolog conditions.

The command parses each \verb!<Sent>! using the currently loaded
grammar, and checks that the \verb!<Pattern>! matches it. It warns
about patterns that fail to match, and print summary statistics.
