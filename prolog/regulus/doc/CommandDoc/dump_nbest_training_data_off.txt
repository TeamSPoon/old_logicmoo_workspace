When doing batch speech translation, using {\tt
TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS} and allied commands, it is optionally
possible to write out N-best training data if the config file
parameter {\tt nbest\_\-training\_\-data\_\-file} is defined. Output
is written to the file in question. This command turns off the
behaviour.
