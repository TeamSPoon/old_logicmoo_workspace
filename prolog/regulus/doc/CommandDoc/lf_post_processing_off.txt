The grammar processing mechanism currently supports three main types
of semantics: linear, Almost Flat Functional (AFF) and RIACS. For
AFF and RIACS semantics, the original logical form produced by the
grammar needs to be post-processed.

This command switches off post-processing of LFs, making it possible
to examine the original logical form, and is in particular useful when
you suspect a post-processing bug.
