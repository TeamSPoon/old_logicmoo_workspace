Parameterised version of UPDATE\_\-TRANSLATION\_\-JUDGEMENTS\_\-SPEECH. Update
the translation judgements file, defined by the
translation\_\-corpus\_\-judgements config file entry, from the output of
the speech translation corpus output file, defined by the
translation\_\-speech\_\-corpus\_\-results($\langle$Arg$\rangle$) config file entry. This
command should be used after editing the output file produced by the
TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS $\langle$Arg$\rangle$ or TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS\_\-AGAIN $\langle$Arg$\rangle$
command. Editing should replace question marks by valid judgements,
currently 'good', 'ok' or 'bad'.
