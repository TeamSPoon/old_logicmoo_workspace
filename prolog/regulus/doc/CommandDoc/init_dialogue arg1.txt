In dialogue mode, initialises the dialogue state, passing it the
specified argument. For this to make sense, you need to have 
previously invoked the {\tt LOAD\_\-DIALOGUE} command, and 
the predicate {\tt initial\_\-dialogue\_\-state/2} needs to be
defined. This predicate will be called to obtain the new dialogue
state and perform any relevant initialisation. The argument
to {\tt INIT\_\-DIALOGUE} is passed as the first argument, and
the state is returned as the second argument.
