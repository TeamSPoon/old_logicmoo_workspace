Command relevant to interlingua-based translation applications which
use backtranslation (cf. Section~\ref{Section:Backtranslation}). The
assumption is that translation is from Source to Interlingua, and
backtranslation is thus from Interlingua to Source.

The argument to the command should be an output file produced by doing 
{\tt TRANSLATE\_\-CORPUS} (cf. Section~\ref{Section:TRANSLATE--CORPUS})
in the Source $\rightarrow$ Source environment. The command is however run
in the Source $\rightarrow$ Interlingua environment. The intent is to
check that the result of backtranslation is an expression which, when
parsed in the Source language and translated back into Interlingua,
would produce the same Interlingua representation as the one produced by performing
the Source $\rightarrow$ Source translation. Examples which fail to
give a match are flagged.
