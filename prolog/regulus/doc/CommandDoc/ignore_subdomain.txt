Relevant to applications using grammar specialisation. Sometimes, you
will have defined multiple subdomains, but you will only be carrying
out development in one of them. In this case, you can speed up EBL
training by temporarily adding ignore\_\-subdomain declarations in the
config file. An ignore\_\-subdomain declaration has the form
\begin{verbatim}
regulus_config(ignore_subdomain, <Tag>).
\end{verbatim}
The effect is to remove all references to $\langle$Tag$\rangle$ when performing training, and not build any specialised grammar for $\langle$Tag$\rangle$. You may include any number of ignore\_\-subdomain declarations.
