Parameterised version of TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS. Process speech mode
translation corpus, defined by the translation\_\-speech\_\-corpus($\langle$Arg$\rangle$)
config file entry. The output file, defined by the
translation\_\-speech\_\-corpus\_\-results($\langle$Arg) config file entry, contains
question marks for translations that have not yet been judged. If
these are replaced by valid judgements, currently 'good', 'ok' or
'bad', the new judgements can be incorporated into the stored
translation judgements file using the command
UPDATE\_\-TRANSLATION\_\-JUDGEMENTS\_\-SPEECH $\langle$Arg$\rangle$. A second output file,
defined by the translation\_\-corpus\_\-tmp\_\-recognition\_\-judgements($\langle$Arg$\rangle$)
config file entry, contains "blank" recognition judgements: here, the
question marks should be replaced with either 'y' (acceptable
recognition), or 'n' (unacceptable recognition). Recognition
judgements can be updated using the UPDATE\_\-RECOGNITION\_\-JUDGEMENTS
$\langle$Arg$\rangle$ command.
