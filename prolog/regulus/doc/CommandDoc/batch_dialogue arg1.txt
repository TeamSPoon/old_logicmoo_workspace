Parameterised version of BATCH\_\-DIALOGUE. Process the default dialogue
mode development corpus, defined by the dialogue\_\-corpus($\langle$Arg$\rangle$) config
file entry. The output file, defined by the
dialogue\_\-corpus\_\-results($\langle$Arg$\rangle$) config file entry, contains question
marks for dialogue processing steps that have not yet been judged. If
these are replaced by valid judgements, currently 'good', or 'bad',
the new judgements can be incorporated into the dialogue judgements
file (defined by the dialogue\_\-corpus\_\-judgements config file entry)
using the command UPDATE\_\-DIALOGUE\_\-JUDGEMENTS $\langle$Arg$\rangle$.
