In dialogue processing applications where words like ``I'' and ``me''
are used, it can be important to know the identity of the speaker; for
example, in the Calendar application, one could say ``When is my next
meeting?'' or ``Am I attending a meeting on Friday?''  The {\tt
DIALOGUE\_\-SPEAKER} command makes it possible to print the identity
of the notional speaker from the command-line.  The notional speaker
can also be retrieved using the predicate {\tt
get\_\-notional\_\-speaker/1} in {\tt PrologLib/utilities.pl}.
