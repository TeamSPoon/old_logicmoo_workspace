Points to the file of training examples used as input to the
EBL\_\-TREEBANK operation. Intended originally for use for grammar
specialisation, but can also be used simply to parse a set of examples
to get information about coverage. The format is sent(Atom), so for
example a typical line would be
\begin{verbatim}
sent('switch off the light').
\end{verbatim}
(note the closing period).

If the application compiles multiple top-level specialised grammars,
the grammars relevant to each example are defined in an optional
second argument. For example, if a home control domain had separate
grammars for each room, a typical line in the training file might be
\begin{verbatim}
sent('switch off the light', [bedroom, kitchen, living_room]).
\end{verbatim}
