Relevant to translation applications. Points to the file containing
the generation grammar. Normally this will be a Regulus grammar
compiled for generation. The translation code currently assumes that
this file will define the module generator, and that the top-level
predicate will be of the form
\begin{verbatim}
generator:generate(Representation, Tree, Words)
\end{verbatim}
