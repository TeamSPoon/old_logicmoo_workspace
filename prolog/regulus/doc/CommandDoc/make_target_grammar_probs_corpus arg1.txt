Relevant to translation applications. Take the results held in the
file indicated by {\tt translation\_\-corpus\_\-results} and turn them into
a training file for Nuance PCFG tuning, using the argument as the
relevant Nuance grammar. Put the result in the file indicated by
{\tt target\_\-grammar\_\-probs}. Thus, for example, the call
\begin{verbatim}
MAKE_TARGET_GRAMMAR_PROBS_CORPUS .MAIN
\end{verbatim}
will create a file where, for each translation {\tt $\langle$Sent$\rangle$}
in {\tt translation\_\-corpus\_\-results}, the file {\tt target\_\-grammar\_\-probs}
will contain a record of the form
\begin{verbatim}
.MAIN <Sent>
\end{verbatim}
