Parameterised version of
UPDATE\_\-TRANSLATION\_\-JUDGEMENTS\_\-SPEECH\_\-CSV. Update the
translation judgements file, defined by the
translation\_\-corpus\_\-judgements config file entry, from the output
of the speech translation corpus output file, defined by the
translation\_\-speech\_\-corpus\_\-results($\langle$Arg$\rangle$)
config file entry. This command should be used after editing the CSV
version of the output file produced by the
TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS $\langle$Arg$\rangle$ or
TRANSLATE\_\-SPEECH\_\-CORPUS\_\-AGAIN $\langle$Arg$\rangle$
command. Editing should replace question marks in the first column by
valid judgements, currently 'good', 'ok' or 'bad'.
