Relevant to applications which use multiple parallel grammars, and
need to convert recognition results either to the {\em original
script} or to the {\em gloss script}. The parallel original script and
gloss script grammars first need to be compiled into generation
grammar form.  They must then be declared using one or both of the
parameters {\tt original\_\-script\_\-recognition\_\-generation\_\-rules} and
{\tt gloss\_\-recognition\_\-generation\_\-rules}. The command
{\tt LOAD\_\-RECOGNITION\_\-GENERATION} loads any parallel
generation grammars that may be declared.
