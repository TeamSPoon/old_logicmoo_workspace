When Mel Cotton sister found her in October 2003, the Velocity Credit Union teller was dead of multiple stab wounds in her apartment bedroom. Cotton 5 year old son was at the North Austin apartment, too, bleeding from stab wounds of his own.
Police quickly charged Abilene native and ex convict Milton Dwayne Gobert, then 30, with capital murder. They said Gobert knew Cotton, 30, through his ex girlfriend and theorized that he was angry at Cotton for helping his ex move out of the apartment the couple had shared.
Pretrial appeals delayed the case for years, but today at 9 a.m., in state District Judge Bob Perkins Travis County courtroom, lawyers will make opening statements in Gobert capital murder trial.
One witness during the trial, which is expected to take at least a week, will be the boy, now 11, that Gobert is accused of stabbing that day.
Gobert, 37, could receive the death penalty if convicted.
Sparkle Smith, Cotton niece, said justice is long overdue.
&quot;For our family, it kind of like an open wound,&quot; said Smith, who lives in Oklahoma and will travel to Austin for the trial.
Gobert will testify that he killed Cotton, said Leonard Martinez, one of his lawyers. Martinez said that the two had a long and at times intimate relationship and that the fatal stabbing came in a fit of passion.
Gobert might be guilty of murder, Martinez said, but not of committing the crime in the course of a robbery or kidnapping, the accusations that if proved would make it a capital crime and eligible for a death sentence. Prosecutors claim that he took Cotton purse and other items from the house and that he tied up Cotton and her son, which they argue is kidnapping.
Michael Gobert, an associate pastor at Little Vine Baptist Church in Manor, said that his brother made a mistake that day but that he is &quot;not a monster&quot; and his life is worth sparing.
&quot;I believe in my brother, and I believe that my brother would never openly and willingly take a life,&quot; Michael Gobert said.
Milton Gobert was raised in Abilene, the second youngest of four children, by his mother, a licensed vocational nurse at the state school there. His father was not in the picture, according to his brother.
Michael Gobert said that their family was not rich but that their mother &quot;broke her back to make sure we had what we needed.&quot;
&quot;We grew up in a Christian home, and we grew up with a loving mother,&quot; he said.
When Milton Gobert was 5, he was struck while walking by a newspaper delivery vehicle and hit his head, his brother said. He spent more than two months in a body cast, and his behavior after the accident caught his family attention.
&quot;His moods changed a lot,&quot; Michael Gobert said. &quot;He was a happy go lucky kid; then after (the accident), you would tend to see him have temper tantrums.&quot;
Michael Gobert said that from that point on, his brother has been quick to anger.
&quot;You could see his anger. You knew he was angry,&quot; he said.
Michael Gobert recalls that while they were growing up he taught his brother to &quot;fight to the finish,&quot; a lesson he fears Gobert followed that night with Cotton.
&quot;It was a belief I had growing up that you fight ... until you know that a person can t hurt you again,&quot; Michael Gobert said.
Milton Gobert began getting into serious trouble in high school, his brother said, declining to elaborate. During Milton Gobert senior year, he went to live in Wichita Falls with his brother, who attended college there.
He stayed out of trouble that year but returned to Abilene in 1991, Michael Gobert said.
From 1991 to 1993, according to filings by prosecutors and court records, Milton Gobert committed robbery, burglary of a habitation, false imprisonment, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, assault, aggravated assault and carrying a prohibited weapon in Taylor County, whose largest city is Abilene. In March 1994, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison for robbery and 10 years in prison for burglary of a habitation, with the sentences to run together, according to Texas prison officials.
Mel Kernena &quot;Nina&quot; Cotton was raised in the far North Texas city of Wichita Falls, the youngest of 10 siblings, said prosecutor Gary Cobb.
After arriving in Austin, she worked security for the now closed Midtown Live nightclub in East Austin and then worked as a credit union teller for about three years before her death.
After Cotton death, Velocity Credit Union CEO Larry Strong, who died in 2008, told the American Statesman that Cotton often talked about the struggles of being a single parent but that she worked to make sure her son was polite and did well in school.
Cotton, who worked at the East 12th Street credit union headquarters, also had a gift for lifting the spirits of co workers, Strong said.
&quot;I sort of coined her the credit union morale officer, &quot; Strong said. &quot;She just loved people.&quot;

It might have felt like spring on Sunday, but wintry weather is expected to return Tuesday, bringing perhaps the best chance of snow this season.
Forecasters are calling for a 60 percent chance of precipitation, a &quot;wintry mix&quot; that could range from a cold rain to ice to sleet to snow, on Tuesday.
Not much accumulation is expected in Austin less than 1 inch but areas north of Austin, including Williamson County, could see 1 to 2 inches of snow, according to National Weather Service forecaster Amanda Fanning. The wintry mix is expected to hit Tuesday afternoon and continue into the evening.
It a big change from Sunday, when sunny skies and a high of 77 degrees at the Austin Bergstrom International Airport which tied the year highest temperature so far brought out plenty of joggers, bicyclists and convertible owners in Central Texas.
Today will be cooler with sunny skies and highs near 60 degrees, but prepare to get out the winter jackets and snow boots? on Tuesday.
A &quot;very strong cold front&quot; will move through the area Tuesday morning, dropping daytime temperatures into the upper 30s, Chris Morris of the National Weather Service said. The mercury will dip to around 30 that night, so snow could form, but the ground will be too warm for it to stick to roads, forecasters said.
On Wednesday, highs will be near 50, and overnight lows will be slightly lower than on Tuesday, Morris said. From there, temperatures will rise into the 50s on Thursday, with overnight lows around 40.
Over the weekend, temperatures will climb into the 60s, but skies are expected to turn cloudy once again.

As a reality check, sometimes I think back to my pre journalism self, the petroleum engineer working in Denver in 1983.
That guy read two Denver newspapers each day, often USA Today as well, and subscribed to Time, Newsweek, the New Yorker and some other magazines. He knew quite a bit about international and national news, some Colorado state stuff and who the mayor of Denver was. And, oh yes, the name of every starter and backup on the Denver Broncos offensive line.
But Ben Wear, circa 1983, had no idea who his state representative or state senator was, and he did not know there was such a thing as a tax on gasoline. If you d asked me then how Colorado pays for roads, I probably would have said from sales or property or income taxes.
And I m pretty sure that edition of Ben Wear wouldn t have read most of the articles written by the current me, no matter how gloriously composed. As I say, reality check.
All this came to mind when I saw the results of a recent poll by Texas newspapers. Aside from asking about the high profile stuff like the governor race, the pollsters posed two transportation related questions. One asked how you would balance the budget, with a big potential deficit looming. By cutting funding for highways, education or health care for the poor, or by raising taxes?
The very next question, oddly, asked about how to pay for &quot;more needed highway construction.&quot; Among the nine options: higher state gas taxes, more toll roads, more borrowing using bonds, or local gas taxes.
On that second question, 16 percent said raise the gas tax and 21 percent wanted more toll roads, with similar percentages for some other choices. Most options were in effect opposed by four out of five people.
But the head shaker came on the first question: 41 percent said cut highway costs.
That doesn t even make sense. Under the Texas Constitution, 75 percent of gas tax revenue must go to highway spending (and a quarter to education). So if you cut highway spending, the gas tax money would just sit there. The deficit on the rest of state spending would remain.
As it happens, the projected statewide deficit and the Texas Department of Transportation two year budget are about the same: $16 billion. So, were those 41 percent saying, send TxDOT 14,000 employees home for good and let our roads molder into gravel over the next decade? Are they stupid, or what?
No, just uninformed. Inevitably, reasonably, uninformed, like that guy back in Denver. They ve got jobs to do, families to tend and avocations to pursue. That why in a republic we elect politicians to sit through boring meetings, read arcane reports and then make decisions. So regular people, other than a few activists and reporters, don t have to.
If Ben Wear Version 1983 had been asked if Colorado highway spending should be cut, he might have said yes. For what it was worth.

Hundreds of Austin elementary school students braved a cold, drizzly Saturday morning at Burger Center to complete the final lap of 26.2 miles and earn their finisher medals for Marathon Kids, a free six month program aimed at promoting an active, healthy lifestyle.
The stadium echoed with cheers of &quot;We did it!&quot; from the kids as they ran to the music of Miley Cyrus and Beyonce. Students were congratulated by Austin school district administrators, Mayor Lee Leffingwell, Mayor Pro Tem Mike Martinez and Ironwoman triathlete Desiree Ficker.
&quot;It feels great,&quot; said 10 year old twins Alison and Vanessa Brook, fourth graders at Summitt Elementary. The two were among the group that completed the marathon during a ceremony in which the national anthem was played.
&quot;It cool that I was in the first group to finish the marathon,&quot; said Vanessa who, along with her sister, completed Marathon Kids for the fourth time.
Marathon Kids was started in Austin 13 years ago and has spread to Dallas, Houston, the Rio Grande Valley, Baltimore, Los Angeles and Chicago. Seventeen Austin area public school districts, home schools and private schools participate in the program, which is presented by Whole Foods Market and supporting sponsor Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas.
This year, 72,000 Austin area children registered with Marathon Kids, according to the program; last year, the completion rate was 85 percent.
Students who attempt Marathon Kids are given a running log to keep track of the distance they ve run or walked toward the 26.2 mile goal and a fuel log for recording the 26.2 days during which they eat five daily servings of fruits and vegetables.
&quot;It was pretty hard to eat my vegetables,&quot; said 7 year old Steven Powell, a student at Baranoff Elementary. &quot;I just drank V8 juice, because it tastes better.&quot;
Like most participants, Steven ran many of his miles at home with his father, Bobby Powell. Together they ran about a mile several nights a week.
&quot;It something that we do as a family year round,&quot; Bobby Powell said.
Austin district physical education coordinator Michele Rusnak said the mission of Marathon Kids is to bring families together so that they can learn to develop a healthy lifestyle.
&quot;It helps keep me in shape, too,&quot; said Evary Carreon , whose 11 year old daughter Elizabeth completed Marathon Kids. &quot;We run for 40 minutes every other day, and we hope to keep it up.&quot;

In a run up to their last full week of campaigning before the March 2 primary, the Republican contenders for governor crisscrossed parts of the state Saturday insisting that Texas can be greater if they are elected.
Playing on his anti Washington campaign theme during stops in Central Texas, Gov. Rick Perry extolled Texas relatively stable economy in urging supporters to make sure it will continue by re electing him.
&quot;There is a land of opportunity in America today, and it is called Texas,&quot; Perry said to applause. &quot;As long as I am governor, I will continue to tell Washington no to cockamamie ideas that will hurt our economy and hurt Texas.&quot;
In South Texas, US Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison hammered away on the theme that Texas needs a change in leadership, after Perry near decade in office.
Hutchison told a crowd in Corpus Christi that Texas might be leading the pack today but cannot rest on its past success.
&quot;We can t just walk and strut around and say we re the best so everything should stay the same,&quot; Hutchison told the crowd. &quot;Status quo will never be good enough for the best.&quot;
Perry, appearing with first lady Anita Perry at a short rally in Austin, took several direct shots at Hutchison as he continued to criticize current policies in Washington.
&quot;It easy to go to Washington and be popular,&quot; he said. &quot;You just say yes to everything.&quot;
He said the growing list of federal mandates and rampant spending will thwart the nation economic recovery.
Citing the anti Washington &quot;tea party&quot; movement, Perry said he supports their message to Washington that &quot;we don t like what you re doing with our money, and we don t like what you re doing with out future.&quot;
&quot;What is occurring now has been since April 15 of last year is that people are reading the Constitution and they re thinking about how their government is working how it supposed to work,&quot; he said. &quot;Our democracy is becoming energized. ... People are as engaged as I ve ever seen them. That good.&quot;
But Nueces County Republicans who gathered at a Hutchison sponsored pachanga say Perry has not been good for the party and it is time for him to go.
He has amassed too much power for himself while letting the Republican Party statewide power diminish, as indicated by the loss of seats in the Texas House, said Richard Bowers, a Hutchison campaign volunteer.
Hutchison is a &quot;party builder, and Rick isn t,&quot; Bowers said.
The pachanga, which featured Mexican food and drink and music, drew together more than 20 local Republicans running for office, a record for the GOP ticket here, party officials said.
The senator has been instrumental in helping the local community without asking anything in return, said Mike Bertuzzi, chairman of the Nueces County Republican Party. &quot;There is a difference between a statesman and a politician,&quot; Bertuzzi said. &quot;And she is a statesman.&quot;
Organizers expected some 600 people to attend throughout the event. But when Hutchison, the main attraction, came on stage about 5:30 p.m. the crowd numbered around 150.
In her 10 minute speech, Hutchison hit on some local economic development issues as well as her campaign standards: high school dropouts, high taxes and Perry cronyism.
In her travels around the state, Hutchison said, people tell her they are afraid to go against the governor. &quot;That not Texas. That not freedom,&quot; Hutchison said.
Jerry Browning of Portland, an undecided voter, said he came to Saturday pachanga looking for some answers.
&quot;Texas is in pretty good shape, so it is hard to argue against a governor who has done fairly well,&quot; Browning said.
Nevertheless, Browning said, he is still open minded.

The Austin school board is set to vote Monday on whether to declare the district in a state of impending fiscal crisis.
Several trustees repeatedly have said they won t approve the declaration of financial exigency, which would allow Superintendent Meria Carstarphen to cut 113 jobs districtwide, even those under contract. Instead, they warmed to an alternative last week that would allow the superintendent to cut programs and the positions associated with them.
The second option would allow the district to avoid a reputation that it can t manage money, some trustees said. But administrators said 18 workers are under multiyear contracts, and cutting those jobs could leave them legally vulnerable.
&quot;Either way, I m hoping we can meet the bottom line,&quot; said Nicole Conley Abram, the district chief financial officer. &quot;It may just mean we have to go back to the drawing board if we re not realizing all the personnel savings.&quot;
With a $711 million operating budget for 2010 11, the district faces a $7.1 million budget gap and wants to spend $64 million on new programs. The budget does not include money for raises.
None of the 113 positions facing elimination are teaching positions; 30 are vacant, 46 are high school positions and 37 are from central office. Cutting all those positions would save the district $6 million. Principals plan to keep all but three of the high school positions, administrators said, which would whittle the savings to less than $4 million.
Under the second option, the 18 multiyear contract jobs are worth $1.4 million, and the workers have the option to be reassigned.
Eighty five percent of the district budget goes toward personnel. School Board President Mark Williams said, &quot;To reduce our spending in a significant way means ... a reduction in force.
&quot;The hope is we can reduce the number of positions but limit the impact on the number of people.&quot;
Kursten Hamilton, the school improvement facilitator for Akins High School, said her job is one of those on the chopping block. She said in the past three years, she has secured several grants and worked to bring in about $500,000 to start a science, technology, engineering and math academy at Akins in the fall.
&quot;The work I have done is worth far more than the small amount of money the district thinks it will save by axing my position,&quot; said Hamilton, a certified teacher. &quot;I can understand the vacant positions being removed, but there are ways to save money other than taking a job away from someone.&quot;
The district should enhance current programs rather than add new programs, including the dual language program being tested in seven schools in 2010 11, she said.
&quot;It a bad financial decision, especially when employees pay the price,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;All I can do now is have faith in the board (to) make the right decision and reduce costs in other ways than stripping people of jobs they love.&quot;
The district has been under a nonteaching hiring freeze since January and has made $14.6 million in cuts already, officials said. But with federal stimulus funds drying up, $127 million to be sent back to the state and an expected 8 percent drop in property tax revenue largely due to a dive in the value of commercial real estate more cuts need to be made. Trustees are scheduled to approve the 2010 11 budget in August.
&quot;We have a whole series of challenges, and these conversations aren t going to end on Monday night,&quot; Williams said. He said the district priorities include dealing with the deficit this year, having competitive compensation for teachers and jump starting new academic programs for the district strategic plan.
Louis Malfaro, president of Education Austin, a group that represents more than 4,000 educators, said his group would be watching the district to make sure any employees affected by the reduction in force are treated fairly. Malfaro has said that he is against layoffs but does not oppose eliminating vacant positions or shifting workers to other jobs.
&quot;If there is a (reduction in force) and there are individuals they are non renewing or terminating, we ll be monitoring that,&quot; he said.
Malfaro also challenges the assertion that the district is in a fiscal crisis and said he would ask the board on Monday to allow for an election for a tax increase to pay for 3 percent raises for teachers. He argues that with property tax appraisals going down and a bevy of new academic programs planned, now is the right time to ask the voters to reinvest in education.
&quot;We cut last year. We cut again this year. We eliminated positions. We re cutting programs,&quot; he said. Malfaro said the district is getting lean but that community members continue to ask for more programs. &quot;Guess what, people? If you want this kind of stuff in your public schools, you have to pay for it.&quot;

Flying an airplane into a multistory, glass covered building is a symbolically powerful act, even 8{1/2} years after the Sept. 11 attacks.
But it was Andrew Joseph Stack III online manifesto describing a life of powerlessness in the face of government hostility and corporate greed that clearly struck a national nerve last week.
Reaction to his note raced through an already polarized America in a way that spoke volumes about the national mood. It was as if Stack, who authorities have said was the pilot, held up a mirror, and we saw what we wanted to see.
Some lauded Stack as a hero in the war against an oppressive government or a crooked tax system.
Others dismissed the Austin man as a terrorist or cowardly criminal who targeted innocents.
And somewhere in the middle were some who believed Stack, though misguided and wrong, articulated their frustrations with economic hardship made worse by unresponsive politicians or greedy corporate fat cats.
Like others driven to political violence, Stack angry rant focused on two themes class based anger in a time of economic crisis and frustration over having no effective way to voice grievances or improve lives, said Dana Cloud, a University of Texas associate professor who studies violence as a political expression.
&quot;What he wrote has tapped into some common concerns, and people are talking,&quot; Cloud said. &quot;It speaks to a deep sense of disaffection and unsettlement. ... I think his action is an index of popular anger and frustration.&quot;
Shortly after Thursday crash, Facebook pages praising Stack generated hundreds of followers and a flurry of comments, including these on a site titled &quot;Joseph Andrew Stack, we salute thee&quot;:
&quot;Wow, at least someone stood up for us.&quot;
&quot;Stack was a terrorist. He is no better than those behind 9 11.&quot;
&quot;He did what he did to make a point and clear up our vision, the only way our government would understand. I just hope people realize this, and do not dismiss him as another nutjob rebel stereotype.&quot;
And just like in many blogs or newspaper stories about the plane crash, commenters unleashed a stream of vitriol and ridicule directed at liberals, conservatives, conspiracy theorists or those striving for a middle ground.
Unsurprised by the strong reaction was UT classics professor Tom Palaima, who studies society and violence.
&quot;Violence of any sort whether a tragic accident, a terrorist attack or something like this if it hits your psyche, it impossible for human beings not to react on some level. I say the molecules of your soul have been moved around,&quot; Palaima said.
&quot;There no such thing as an act of violence that does not send out shock waves that we all feel,&quot; he said.
The shock waves from the plane crash rolled across a nation experiencing economic turmoil and two wars in a frequently bitter political climate.
Think about December jobless numbers, Palaima said. The US economy lost 85,000 jobs, but the unemployment rate remained at 10 percent because so many people were no longer counted. They d given up looking for work.
&quot;What is that but a way of simply disappearing human beings who are really suffering?&quot; he said. &quot;There are real problems in American society, a kind of fragmentation. People are feeling that they re isolated, that there isn t any sense of understanding of what individuals are going through.&quot;
Stack manifesto arrived seething with frustration, sadness and self pity into a climate where anger at the Bush administration swept Barack Obama into the White House, and a vocally angry tea party movement hopes to sweep him out again.
&quot;There has never been a politician (who) cast a vote on any matter with the likes of me or my interests in mind. Nor, for that matter, are they the least bit interested in me or anything I have to say,&quot; Stack wrote.
Elsewhere, Stack railed against a tax system misunderstood even by experts that penalizes middle class taxpayers for mistakes. &quot;If this is not the measure of a totalitarian regime, nothing is,&quot; he wrote.
&quot;This provided an event for people to begin to express their views on a lot of underlying anger that we re seeing in the political discussion,&quot; said UT psychology professor Art Markman.
But Markman, who studies the culture of aggression and anger, was struck by a more personal aspect of Thursday tragedy: Stack written description of his manifesto as a therapeutic exercise.
&quot;It often possible to write your way out of anxiety and anger,&quot; Markman said. &quot;Where he goes wrong is that he writes in a way that allows him to reinforce all of the causes of his anger. He puts the blame for all scenarios in his life outside of himself, mostly on the government, so he doesn t give himself any way of defusing his own anger.&quot;
Stack friends, interviewed after Thursday plane crash, said he never discussed his financial problems or conflicts with the Internal Revenue Service, Markman noted.
&quot;He was caught in a spiral of anxiety and anger ... that he reinforced internally without talking to people who might be able to provide an alternate perspective,&quot; Markman said.
The result appears to have been a public suicide doubling as a political statement one that will continue to be debated in a politically and economically fractured nation.

Late last year, with state and federal financial regulators closing in on his web of businesses, Triton Financial founder Kurt Barton initiated a series of paper transfers divesting him of more than $1 million in personal property that was on the verge of being placed under the control of a court appointed receiver.
On Dec. 15, Barton transferred, for a total price of $10, three vehicles to his wife Suzanne name: a 2006 Dodge Ram Mega Cab truck; a 2008 BMW touring motorcycle; and a 2005 Steed, a specialized chopper motorcycle that can sell for up to $40,000 new. Barton handed over sole ownership of a 2008 Cadillac Escalade to his wife in exchange for her assuming its loan payments, Travis County property records show.
Barton also took his name off the deed for the couple house in Austin gated Uplands neighborhood, which tax records show is valued at $644,000. It is now in his wife name only. A day later, property records in Hays County show, he transferred a 50 acre ranch assessed at $651,000 and owned jointly by the couple to her name only.
The sale price for each of the homes, according to the bills of sale: &quot;Love of, and affection for, Grantee.&quot; All told, Barton erased his name from property totaling nearly $1.4 million.
Barton attorney, Joe Turner, did not return calls. Regulators said that they have become aware of the mid December transfers and that the Bartons are cooperating fully with them.
&quot;It appears that he was trying to protect assets for his family,&quot; said Steven Harr, the court appointed receiver now in control of Barton personal and business assets. &quot;They re working with me to solve that problem.&quot;
Barton, the CEO of Triton Financial, would have known the company was on shaky ground when he removed his name from the properties. On Dec. 11, a woman had confronted him in his office with a gun, distraught over what she said was the loss of her $125,000 investment. In the days leading up to the transfers, investors filed three separate lawsuits against Triton, charging that Barton had mishandled their money.
Meanwhile, Texas and federal investigators had been scrutinizing Triton, which enlisted several famous local athletes to promote its investments, said Bob Elder, a spokesman for the Texas State Securities Board. &quot;We had been in touch with him for several months,&quot; he said. &quot;I don t think there was any doubt about the severity of what he was facing.&quot;
On Dec. 22, exactly one week after the property transfers, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit in US District Court accusing Triton and Barton of securities fraud. It said Barton raised money that he told investors would be used to invest in an insurance company, but which he instead diverted to buy an equipment leasing company without their knowledge.
On the same day, the state securities board acted to revoke Barton Texas financial adviser license, charging that he had perpetrated a &quot;shell game&quot; that used new investors money to pay returns to previous investors. State regulators also asserted that Barton invented companies and altered documents in an attempt to deceive investors.
No criminal charges have been filed against Barton, the only individual named in the regulators actions against Triton. None of the famous sports figures who promoted the company, including Heisman Trophy winners Ty Detmer, Earl Campbell and Chris Weinke, have been identified as targets of the regulators actions.
Since being appointed receiver of Barton assets two months ago, Harr has been scouring Barton and Triton financial records, looking for anything of value that might be used to repay defrauded investors. He said it was still too early to tell how many Triton investors lost money or how much they lost.
Over the past several years, Barton spun a complex web of partnerships and corporations. It its complaint, the SEC identified 40 entities &quot;sponsored&quot; by Triton.
It is unclear how many of those actually were used to collect money. But public records show that Barton and Triton, which promoted &quot;alternative investments,&quot; pursued a wide range of businesses over the past several years, using investors money to collect such varied assets as a health club, car dealerships, low income apartment complexes, warehouses and office buildings.
So far, Harr has sold off two vehicles, court filings show: a 2003 Hummer H2 and a 2008 Mercury Mariner, a small SUV, for a total of $26,000. Both were registered under Triton Financial.
&quot;I m going to find every asset I can and turn it into as much money as I can,&quot; Harr said.
Even investors who now worry that they will lose money through their connection with Kurt Barton agree that the founder and CEO of Triton Financial appeared to know his real estate, at least early on.
In 2004 and 2005, Joe Straubhaar invested in several apartment complexes Barton had purchased in and around Austin. The deals, in which Barton quickly rehabbed the properties and sold them, paid out returns as high as 15 percent, Straubhaar said.
He added that such successes inspired confidence in Barton as a money manager. Most of the profits Barton told him he d earned were poured back into new deals.
&quot;He seemed to have a good eye for such properties,&quot; Straubhaar said, adding that much of the several hundred thousand dollars he invested with Barton now appears gone.
&quot;He would find some distressed property and buy it at the right price,&quot; said Greg Gill, a California investor who said that in 2006 he purchased a 20 percent interest in an office building west of Austin that Barton renamed Triton Plaza. &quot;It been a real successful project.&quot;
Gill said that success convinced him to invest more money with Triton. &quot;He seemed to me he was real, and he proved he was,&quot; Gill said.
Now, however, Gill said he stands to lose money, although he declined to specify how much.
Public records in Texas and outside the state, as well as an internal Triton document purporting to list company assets obtained by the American Statesman from a person who had business dealings with Barton, show that he continues to control millions of dollars worth of real estate. Yet the document also indicates and Harr confirms that most of the properties are heavily encumbered by debt.
According to county property records, for example, Triton Plaza and Triton headquarters building, both on Bee Cave Road, have a total assessed value of $6.75 million. According to Triton internal asset list, however, lenders are owed nearly $6 million on the buildings.
Public records also show that Triton, through a half dozen partnerships, controls several car lots in and around Central Texas. That because in 2007 Barton decided to get into the car business.
Jack Pagan, whose family has operated dealerships in Texas for a half century, was called in to help. At first, he was impressed. &quot;I went into the nice, plush offices, saw the expensive cars, heard about the private planes,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I thought these guys had the loot. &quot;

Oh, goodie. We ve got two candidates for Texas governor who said they aren t so sure the US government didn t fly the planes on 9/11.
Tea party favorite Debra Medina went first when she told right wing blabbologist Glenn Beck she hadn t &quot;taken a position&quot; on whether the feds had destroyed the World Trade Center.
&quot;I think some very good questions have been raised in that regard,&quot; she said. Yeah, like: &quot;What are you? Crazy?&quot;
She later said she didn t believe the US government was involved and that she was caught off guard by the question. I wonder if I offered to sell her my secret formula for turning tomato aspic into a rib plate if she d be caught off guard by the offer.
Democrat Farouk Shami, the hair products dude, went next.
&quot;I m not sure,&quot; Shami said when asked if the government was in on 9/11. &quot;I am not going to really judge or answer about something I m not sure about. But the rumors are there that there was a conspiracy.&quot;
Maybe Shami was snorting his own Aqua Net. Either way, when he said he wouldn t answer something he wasn t sure about, he violated a major tenet of American politics. If all candidates refused to discuss subjects they didn t know jack about, a vast silence would envelop the land.
The sad part here is that I suspect both candidates aren t stupid enough to believe those evildoers in Washington had anything to do with 9/11. They just don t want to blow off the wingnut vote. They want everybody to love them, even the screwballs.
It a rookie mistake. You can t please everybody, but people running for office for the first time give it their best shot, especially when you ve got a group that votes as a bloc like the blockheads who believe Dick Cheney flew in a Superman suit into the side of the World Trade Center with plastique sewed into his shorts.
Why would Cheney do that? If he caught himself, he d have to waterboard himself to get to the bottom of it:
&quot;That Dick Cheney. He waterboarding himself in the next room.&quot;
&quot;Gee willikers, would somebody hand him a towel?&quot;
There are more pressing questions beyond George W Bush possible involvement with 9/11 that our gubernatorial candidates should be asked. For example, did the dish really run away with the spoon, and, you know, did the little dog laugh to see such sport?
Then there the conspiracy theorist favorite question: Is you is, or is you ain t, my baby? Both Medina and Shami footsies should be held to the fire on that one.
So many questions for our gubernatorial hopefuls, so little time. As in: Hey, diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle, but did the cow really jump over the moon?

Three Austin doctors were among 70 physicians disciplined earlier this month by the Texas Medical Board, including two who are on board imposed probation and no longer practice medicine but could again someday.
Dr. Daniel J Di Bona was already serving a 10 year probation stemming from a substance abuse order and problems practicing because of side effects of medication and numerous medical problems, the board said. Di Bona voluntarily ended his internal medicine practice in March 2008 to safeguard the public, the order said.
The board said that Di Bona is on disability and that he requested a voluntary suspension &quot;in lieu of further disciplinary proceedings&quot; and to preserve other work options.
The suspension stays in force until he can demonstrate to the board that he can practice safely.
Di Bona current problems are medical, and &quot;he hopes to regain his health and practice again,&quot; said his lawyer, Michael Sharp of Austin.
The board issued a public reprimand and $1,000 fine to Dr. Emily Jane Sandbach , who practiced internal medicine but is teaching college level biology. Sandbach was under a five year probationary order in connection with an episode of depression in 2004, the board said. She failed to meet all of the terms of her probation, prompting the order.
Sandbach did not return a call left at her college office.
The board also ordered family practice doctor Richard John Wiseman to take a medical record keeping course and pay a $1,000 fine for prescribing and dispensing a compounded thyroid hormone to a patient without proper labeling, record keeping or a pharmacy license.
&quot;This situation was simply an instance of providing patients easier access to specifically formulated compounded hormone medications, which are not readily available at most pharmacies,&quot; Wiseman lawyer, Tony Cobos, said. &quot;In the vast majority of states, physicians can in fact dispense medications from their office. Unfortunately, Texas is more restrictive in that regard, and Dr. Wiseman chose to resolve it (the board case) voluntarily rather than to expend fees and resources.&quot;

On Friday, as investigators continued to piece together the past of the man accused of crashing a plane into the Echelon I building in Northwest Austin, some on the Web went about the business of owning a piece of the incident for themselves.
Several Web sites reposted the Web manifesto of Andrew Joseph Stack III One site, thejoestacksuicidenote.com , replicated the look of the original Web posting (taken down Thursday by New Jersey Web company T35 Hosting, which said the removal was at the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation). The site has Google ads embedded between sections of the anti IRS manifesto.
&quot;Owe over 15K to the IRS?&quot; one ad read. Another touted the virtues of TurboTax software.
The Google AdSense program allows Web publishers to put ads on their site that are connected to the site content. The site owner then makes money based on the number of times the page is viewed and the ads are clicked on. Because the note contains words such as &quot;Austin,&quot; &quot;tax&quot; and &quot;IRS,&quot; ads for local tax related businesses were placed on the page by Google program.
One of them was Austin based Escobar &amp; Associates. Sam Turner, owner and lawyer at the tax consultancy firm, said he was unaware of the ads and that his company began using the Google service recently as part of a larger revamping of its aging Web site.
&quot;We definitely didn t pay for an ad endorsing this guy. That news to me,&quot; Turner said. &quot;We started playing with (Google ad services) over the holidays. It just happened to come out as this sad and unintended consequence.
&quot;It seems like a disgusting little bit of profit sharing,&quot; Turner said. The domain name thejoestack
suicidenote.com was registered to a company that shields private information about a registrar.
An e mail to the American Statesman from &quot;Austin Suicide Pilot Update&quot; promoting thejoestacksuicidenote.com included an Austin street address.
That address was for a UPS Store on South Lamar Boulevard that houses mailboxes.
Efforts to track down the owner of the site were unsuccessful, as were attempts to contact the owner of a similarly named site, joestacksuicidenote.com. That site carries no ads. The text of the manifesto is pasted into a WordPress blog format. A note on the site reads, &quot;This website has not been created in any form other than one of neutrality and information bearing.&quot;
The domain name josephstack.com was registered on Thursday, but it contains only a placeholder site.
On a Web site called Newgrounds.com that features user generated games, a user named Falcon posted a game called &quot;Tax Time!&quot; at 5:48 p.m. Thursday.
In the game, players use a gas can to set fire to a house, get on a plane and crash into a building. &quot;Justice is served!&quot; the game announces when the plane hits the building.
A request for an interview with Falcon was not answered in time for this publication of this article, but on the Web site, the game creator says he is 24 and lives in Austin. He previously created a game called &quot;Balloon Boy Adventure.&quot;
As of this writing, &quot;Tax Time!&quot; had been viewed 82,988 times and was rated 4.29 on a scale of 5 by players of the game.

Neighbors say Vernon Hunter was the kind of guy who offered trash collectors Gatorade on hot summer days.
&quot;He was a very spiritual man, kind of the life of the neighborhood,&quot; said Darren McDaniel, who has lived two houses away since their homes were built in 1996. &quot;We were all sort of like his kids.&quot;
Hunter, who public records show is 68, is believed to have been killed in Thursday attack on a Northwest Austin building that housed Internal Revenue Service offices. Andrew Joseph Stack III is suspected of flying his single engine plane into the building.
On Friday , Hunter neighbors and co workers expressed their grief and shock, remembering him as an exceptionally kind man who was the glue both in his neighborhood and at work.
&quot;He always put his people first,&quot; said co worker Chris Matz of Hunter, a collection manager at the IRS &quot;Most of the people in our group are very affected, very traumatized. It a close knit group. We are a family.&quot;
Michiko Robinson called Hunter an excellent supervisor. &quot;He was a very genuine human being,&quot; she said.
Loved ones gathered at the Hunter home in Cedar Park Friday morning as a steady stream of neighbors, family and friends brought food and drinks and offered comfort.
A family representative said the family has not heard from the medical examiner office and was advised by authorities not to comment until a confirmation has been made. Some relatives had not yet been notified of the tragedy, he added.
Meanwhile on Friday, the most seriously injured victim of the crash continued to recuperate at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, where he was listed in stable condition. Shane Hill, an investigator with the criminal investigation division of the Texas comptroller office, received second degree burns to his back.
Comptroller officials said Hill was in good spirits Friday. &quot;He told me he is anxious to get back to work,&quot; his supervisor Max Westbrook said.
Throughout the day Friday, television news trucks parked along the quiet street of the Hunters two story, red brick home. At one point, H E B employees went to the home to donate a couple of boxes of food.
&quot;We were shocked and saddened to hear of the unnecessary loss of Vernon Hunter,&quot; said company spokeswoman Leslie Lockett. &quot;We want to help the Hunter family in any way we can, and sending food to the family and relatives today was our first step in helping them through this tragedy.&quot;
Earlier, police delivered Hunter Chevy Silverado truck, emblazoned with Vietnam Veteran and POW MIA emblems, to the home. Hunter served in Vietnam and often spoke of his time during the war, neighbors said.
Robert Foster, who has lived near Hunter for about 10 years, said that he knew Hunter was a veteran and wanted to honor him with his American flag. &quot;Out of respect to him, when I came out this morning, I put my flag out,&quot; Foster said. &quot;You could talk to him about anything. He always had a smile.&quot;
He was known to friends, co workers and relatives as the one who gave. Hunter is also described as a devout Christian and father of six grown children who loved his white cowboy hat. At Greater Mount Zion Baptist Church in East Austin, where Hunter served as a lead usher, news of the tragedy weighed heavily.
&quot;We re devastated,&quot; said Brian Balque, facilities manager at the church.
Balque said that Hunter had set up the church tax ministry, helping members and local residents with their taxes. &quot;He had a servant heart,&quot; Balque said. &quot;He represented what we stand for as a church, a kind word and a warm spirit.&quot;
Balque said Hunter wife, who also works at the same IRS building and was there when the plane struck, called the church in the minutes afterward asking for prayers for her husband.
McDaniel said their street won t be the same with Hunter gone.
&quot;Everybody loved him in the neighborhood,&quot; McDaniel said. &quot;He in a better place, but the neighborhood is going to seem a little empty without him.&quot;

The five people trapped in the burning Echelon I building Thursday morning after a plane struck couldn t have asked for a better prepared hero than Robin De Haven.
De Haven is 28 and has worked for Austin Binswanger Glass for two years, installing and repairing glass. He said he also was a combat engineer in the Army for more than six years, serving two tours in Iraq.
And he happened to be right around the corner from the building when the plane struck and to have a tall ladder on his work truck.
He said he was driving on Loop 360 (Capital of Texas Highway) on his way to a job in North Austin when he saw the plane fly over the road, then bank and disappear behind a hill.
Then he saw black smoke rising. So he drove toward the smoke.
De Haven said he drove into a parking lot and called 911 about 30 seconds after the plane struck the building. Then, he said, someone approached him, told him people were trapped inside the burning building and asked if he had a ladder.
De Haven said he grabbed the 20 foot ladder off his truck and ran toward the building. When he tried to put the ladder against the building to reach people on the second floor, the bottom of the ladder began sliding on broken glass, he said.
He said he climbed up anyway the ladder slipped about four inches on the way and reached the second floor, crawling through a broken window.
&quot;I was just thinking about what I had to do,&quot; he said.
Inside, he found five people in a room filled with cubicles.
&quot;It OK; we re here to get you,&quot; he said he told them.
They wanted to know what had happened to the building and told him they couldn t exit through the hallway because it was filled with smoke, De Haven said.
He said he was worried about people descending the unstable ladder, so they decided to try exiting another window. He said he was going to throw a chair through the window, but one of the employees had already tried that, without success.
He said someone found a metal rod, and one of the men began using it to beat on the window, which shattered on the third try. De Haven said he cleared the broken glass from the window frame and then helped the four men and one woman climb out onto a ledge that was about 2 feet long and 4 feet wide. Someone on the ground moved the ladder to the ledge, allowing everyone to climb down safely, he said.
By then emergency crews had arrived Austin fire officials said firefighters spotted a Binswanger employee and a ladder at the scene and De Haven got back in his truck and left the scene. He said he stopped at a fast food restaurant to wash his hands when his boss called. He told his boss what had happened, and before long, his phone began ringing with interview requests.
By the end of the day, he d been interviewed by Wolf Blitzer at CNN, Fox News Greta Van Susteren and several local TV stations.
He said he didn t feel like a hero when it happened, but &quot;now I m starting to feel like it, because people are telling me that I was one.&quot;

Chris Toliver was at a conference in Las Vegas when a small plane crashed into an Austin office building Thursday. He watched CNN footage of the smoke and flames shooting from the building.
Toliver leads the disaster preparedness committee of the Building Owners and Managers Association of Austin, which holds seminars for its members on best practices for disaster, emergency and safety measures in commercial buildings.
Toliver said it seemed obvious that emergency evacuation plans were in place at the Echelon I building and that tenants were familiar with them, enabling them to &quot;get out quickly and safely.&quot;
&quot;It appears they didn t hesitate at all,&quot; Toliver said Friday. &quot;They did what they were supposed to do immediately.&quot;
KVA Inc., the leasing agent and property manager for the Echelon I building, is an association member, Toliver said.
Kevin Kimball from the leasing company did not return calls or e mails Friday, and no one from the limited partnership that owns the building could be reached.
According to Austin Fire Department records, the building was last inspected Jan. 22, 2008, with one violation noted, said Michelle DeCrane, a department spokeswoman. That violation was corrected when inspectors followed up three days later, after a master key box for firefighters was added at the entry, she said.
DeCrane said the building sprinkler system was working. However, Thursday fire was so intense that it caused the air conditioning unit to fall through the second floor ceiling, rendering part of the sprinkler system inoperable.
The building was severely damaged by the fire, which took several hours to control.
Public safety authorities have said the incident was a criminal act.
Jerry Hagins, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance, said that the damage from such an incident might be covered under a standard commercial policy.
&quot;There are many facets that would be considered, however, depending on the type of policy,&quot; Hagins said. &quot;Multiple scenarios could play out, and we wouldn t want to speculate&quot; about this case.
Congress Holdings Group, which owns two other buildings in the Echelon complex, said neither of those buildings appeared to have been damaged.
However, if they had been, &quot;we would have had insurance to cover the property loss as well as lost rents,&quot; said Joel Sher, president of Congress Holdings.

No sooner had a pilot crashed his plane into Internal Revenue Service offices in North Austin than commentators, politicians and police were groping with how to describe the attack.
Was it an act of personal rage or, as many officials called it, an act of terrorism? And does such a definition matter?
In terms of legal semantics, not really. No charge of terrorism exists. Had Joe Stack, who authorities said was the pilot, somehow survived, he probably would have been charged with murder, attempted murder and destruction of government offices, according to Bobby Chesney, a University of Texas law professor who specializes in national security statutes.
Terrorism is often described as an unlawful, violent act used to advance a political goal.
&quot;In a way it was terrorism, and in a way it wasn t,&quot; said Ami Pedahzur , the head of the Terrorists, Insurgents and Guerrillas in Education and Research lab at UT &quot;It was targeted at a very symbolic place the IRS offices; clearly the method was a copycat of 9/11; and the guy left a manifesto which seems to have some kind of political agenda in it. He wanted his message out, and he wanted support for his act.
&quot;However, if we look at terrorism as aimed at terrorizing the masses to lead to political change, that was not his goal,&quot; continued Pedahzur. &quot;He seems to be some kind of angered individual who channeled his animosity at the government.&quot;
Does the question of whether it was terrorism even matter?
&quot;We are too obsessed with terrorism,&quot; Pedahzur said. &quot;If there is a psychological atmosphere of being preoccupied with them, then the terrorists are successful.&quot;
Defining the act as terrorism can have &quot;troubling political outcomes,&quot; he said, because it can lead to &quot;restrictions on free speech&quot; for people who express anti government opinions similar to those posted on the Internet by Stack.
Calling it a terrorist act can matter, said Mark Potok , the head of the hate group monitoring Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, for the very reason that it describes participation in a wider movement.
&quot;If the crime is fundamentally a political crime, ideologically driven, then it a wider phenomenon than one angry man who has a lousy life who shooting people around him,&quot; said Potok, whose project has noted at least 75 cases of domestic terror plots, many of them racist rampages, since 1995. &quot;What this really tells us is that the tax protest movement is becoming much more violent.&quot; After the attack, officials disagreed on whether it was terrorism.
Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo, for example, steered clear of the term, saying he did not want to spread panic.
He said that referring to it as terrorism would imply that other planes might be flying into other buildings in Austin or elsewhere.
&quot;This was an isolated event with no ties to international terrorism,&quot; said US Rep. Mike McCaul , R Austin, who serves on the Homeland Security Committee. &quot;But any time you fly an airplane into a federal building to kill people, that an act of terror.&quot;
A similar debate took place after the Fort Hood shootings, which McCaul also called an act of terrorism, drawing links between the shooter and an overseas cleric who had incited violence against the United States.
In a sign of the sensitivity around the terrorism label, the Council on American Islamic Relations issued a statement Thursday condemning the act as a terrorist one.
&quot;Whenever an individual or group attacks civilians in order to make a political statement, that is an act of terror,&quot; said council Executive Director Nihad Awad . &quot;Terrorism is terrorism, regardless of the faith, race or ethnicity of the perpetrator or the victims.&quot;
The group said it would hold a news conference Monday in Washington on what it says is a double standard on the use of the label &quot;terrorism&quot; for acts of violence committed by non Muslims.
But Michael Welner , a New York City psychiatrist who heads the Forensic Panel, a group of forensic scientists who consult on legal cases, said the attack was one of &quot;spectacle murder&quot; and not terrorism.
&quot;The point of terrorism is to bring life to a standstill,&quot; Welner said. &quot;This was not to cause fear in others but to cause rebellion.&quot;

On a day when authorities offered few new details of their investigation, the wife of the man accused of intentionally hurtling his plane into a Northwest Austin office building grieved at the &quot;unimaginable tragedy.&quot;
&quot;Words cannot adequately express my sorrow or the sympathy I feel for everyone affected,&quot; Sheryl Stack, wife of Andrew Joseph Stack III, said in a brief statement that also requested privacy.
Authorities believe Stack, 53, died in the inferno, as did an another person whose remains have been recovered. Two others were injured.
A spokesman read Sheryl Stack comments Friday to dozens of reporters near the family North Austin house, which was gutted by fire shortly before Joe Stack plane took off Thursday.
Authorities said they think Stack flew his single engine Piper Cherokee into a building that houses Internal Revenue Service offices less than an hour after the fire at his house, which remains under investigation.
Stack had left a rambling Internet message expressing disgust at the US tax system.
The impact of the crash officials would not identify the exact point where the plane struck the building caused the four story structure to burst into flames and fire to sweep through it.
Officials said they recovered two bodies from the building and were awaiting forensic exams to confirm their identities. They said they think one body is that of Stack.
Vernon Hunter, a 68 year old IRS employee and Vietnam War veteran whose wife also worked in the building, remained unaccounted for Friday night.
During a news conference near the crash site off Research Boulevard (US 183), federal and local authorities said they are investigating several matters relating to Stack, including whether he might have loaded his plane with explosives or used a detonator to spark the house fire.
The blaze at the house was reported at 9:18 a.m., and the crash occurred at 9:56 a.m., 16 minutes after his takeoff from the Georgetown Municipal Airport. The airport is about 20 miles from his home.
Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo also confirmed that Sheryl Stack had left the couple home Wednesday night and stayed at a hotel. He would not elaborate.
Neighbors have reported seeing Sheryl Stack and a 12 year old girl arrive at the house shortly after the fire broke out.
Acevedo said Austin police had received no reports of domestic violence at the home.
Agents said they also want to learn more about Joe Stack anger at the IRS They asked a Web host to remove Stack letter.
&quot;We are certainly going to be trying to find out what his motivation was,&quot; said Ralph Diaz, special agent in charge of the San Antonio division of the FBI, which includes Austin. &quot;We want to make sure this community understands what took place and give them some rationale, some reasoning, as to why it took place.&quot;
In his letter, Stack said that violence was the only answer and that &quot;nothing changes unless there is a body count. By not adding to the body count, I insure nothing will change.&quot;
Also in his letter, Stack cited his complaints about work done by an Austin accountant, Bill Ross.
At Ross Northwest Austin home, reporters from across the country left business cards at the door, as did a special agent for the Department of the Treasury.
Ross also couldn t be reached at his office.
In Cedar Park, friends and family gathered at the home of Hunter, the missing IRS employee. Several television news trucks parked outside.
A co worker at the house said she wasn t authorized by the family to speak, but others there described him as a devout Christian and an adoring father of six grown children. He loved wearing cowboy hats, they said.
His wife, Valerie, also was in the building when the crash occurred, they said.
According to the Federal Aviation Administration, Stack obtained his private pilot license in 1994 and was authorized to fly single engine planes. He later became qualified to fly multiengine planes and received a rating that allowed him to pilot in bad weather.
Stack had his aviation medical certificate renewed in 2009, FAA officials said.
Dave Page, a shop foreman for a business that services planes at the Lincoln Regional Airport, in Lincoln, Calif., where Stack lived in the late 1990s, said he routinely fueled Stack plane.
Page said he thinks the Piper Cherokee that crashed into the building was the same aircraft he serviced.
He said that Stack was meticulous about the upkeep of the aircraft and that he always found him to be &quot;a normal, hardworking guy.&quot;
&quot;He made the comment a few times that he would go down to the Bay Area and work long hours, then come home and work long hours, like a self employed person trying to make a go of it,&quot; Page said.
Page said that Stack, who also built an experimental airplane on airport property, often told him that his Piper Cherokee &quot;gave him freedom and saved him a lot of time.&quot;

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. Space shuttle Endeavour and its six astronauts have gotten permission to land back in Florida.
Mission Control informed commander George Zamka on Sunday night that the weather has improved at Kennedy Space Center and will be acceptable for a landing. Endeavour is scheduled to touch down at 10:20 p.m.
At one point Sunday, flight controllers were doubtful the weather would cooperate because of clouds and possibly rain.
The astronauts are wrapping up a two week mission that resulted in the virtual completion of the International Space Station. They installed a new room and big bay window. All that left are four shuttle flights to stock the outpost with more experiments, spare parts and supplies.

AUBURN HILLS, Mich. Richard Hamilton scored 27 points and Rodney Stuckey added 20 to lead the Detroit Pistons to a 109 101 victory over the San Antonio Spurs in overtime on Sunday.
Manu Ginobili layup tied the game at 93 with 27.5 seconds left, and the Pistons missed two game winning shots at the end of regulation.
San Antonio started the extra period with a one point lead because Hamilton was called for a technical foul during the break after regulation.
Ginobili made the free throw, but Detroit went on a 8 2 run after the tip and held on for the win.
Tim Duncan had 29 points and 10 rebounds for the Spurs, while Ginobili scored 21.
San Antonio played without Tony Parker, who sat out with a left hip injury.

TYLER, Texas Two men who once attended church together were charged Sunday with intentionally burning down a church in east Texas and are suspected in a string of similar blazes, authorities said.
Jason Robert Bourque, 19, and 21 year old Daniel George McAllister face one count of felony arson for a church fire in rural Smith County near Tyler, about 90 miles east of Dallas, said Tom Crowley, spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
Bond is set at $10 million apiece. They could face life in prison if convicted.
&quot;Because they are charged with one doesn t mean they re not going to be charged with some of the others,&quot; Crowley said.
Crowley and Smith County jail officials said they had no information on attorneys for either men.
Bourque, of nearby Lindale, was arrested early Sunday in Van Zandt County, site of four of 10 church fires in east Texas this year that authorities believe were intentionally set, Crowley said.
McAllister was taken into custody in San Antonio, where Crowley said he had recently moved.
He said Bourque and McAllister used to attend First Baptist Church in McAllister hometown of Ben Wheeler.
The arrests were triggered by a telephone tip, although the suspects had been on the radar for several weeks, Crowley said.
One of the men was linked to the fire with DNA evidence, Crowley said. He said he had no other details on the DNA
Officials declined to discuss a motive at a news conference Sunday. No injuries have been reported in the fires.
The outbreak started with a blaze at a church in Athens, and Crowley said another New Year Day fire not far away has been added to the list of 10 suspected arsons in east Texas. A fire in the central Texas town of Temple, brings to 11 the statewide total of fires authorities believe are attributable to arson.
Authorities have said the federal investigation kicked in after two churches burned Jan. 11 in Athens. Less than a week later, four fires in five days was reported. The two most recent fires included the one that resulted in charges against Bourque and McAllister.
There were attempted break ins at three churches in Tyler in early February, but those buildings were not burned, the Texas Department of Public Safety said in a statement.
&quot;This investigation is not complete. But today marks a significant milestone,&quot; said Robert Champion, ATF agent in charge in Dallas.
David Mahfood, pastor of one of the Tyler churches that burned, said the word of the arrests &quot;puts a period on the paragraphs of our lives,&quot; but said residents still think they must remain vigilant.
&quot;We re blessed that no lives were lost and no one was injured, but I don t think we let our guard down,&quot; Mahfood said.

HOLLISTON, Mass. Hiding from merciless militiamen and trekking through unforgiving mountainous terrain, Madhel Majok escaped the mass slayings and genocide of the Sudan that killed his parents. The 9 year old orphan fled to neighboring Kenya, where he then survived vigilante shellings on his crowded refugee camp.
Majok remained in limbo for eight years while waiting for any country to grant him refuge.
Now 17, Majok has found safety in a small New England enclave 30 miles west of Boston. He a star soccer player at Holliston High School, listens to Tupac and Biggie at his leisure and lives comfortably in a foster home, thanks to a federal program that matches refugee minors with American families.
&quot;I like it. It peaceful... quiet,&quot; said Majok, who wears American urban style clothes and stays in a home with four other refugee Asian and African children. &quot;Took me a long time to get here.&quot;
The US Office of Refugee Resettlement, which has 700 refugee children in foster care, has asked states to prepare to foster more international refugee children like Majok, whose parents either have disappeared or been killed by war or natural disaster. The need is heightened by continuing armed conflicts in Africa and recent events such as the earthquake in Haiti.
The request means that Massachusetts and other states must ask more households to open up their homes for foster care or ask existing foster families to take in another refugee child at a time of economic downturn.
&quot;Between all the wars going on and all the (human) trafficking laws that have changed, more children are needing safe homes,&quot; said Sherrill Hilliard, the program manager for Refugee Immigration &amp; Assistance Program in Washington. &quot;And we re doing our best to find them.&quot;
Massachusetts, a state that historically has taken in one of the largest shares of the nation unaccompanied refugee minors, has been asked to increase its current share of 93 to 125, said Richard Chacon, director of the Office for Refugees and Immigrants in Massachusetts.
The US Department of Health &amp; Human Services says 14 states and the District of Columbia, participate in the federal Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program: Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington.
It is not the only way parentless refugee children can find safe haven in the US The Obama administration, for example, recently said it will allow orphaned Haitian children to enter the US temporarily on an individual basis. And some groups, like the Heartland Alliance in Illinois, help unaccompanied undocumented children by providing housing and legal representation.
The US program, developed in the early 1980s to help thousands of parentless children in Southeast Asia, has aided more than 13,000 refugee children fleeing war, famine and economic turmoil. It remains the most consistent source for refugee children in the US, with the assistance of the United Nations.
In 2008, foster homes and related facilities in the United States and 67 other countries took in 16,300 orphans, according to Tim Irwin, the spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. That the highest number since the agency started keeping records, Irwin said.
In the US, states license foster homes with the help of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. The federal government reimburses states for all costs of the children schooling, health care and related expenses.
It the same federal program that helped resettle 3,800 &quot;Lost Boys&quot; from Sudan in the early 2000s.
Cost of care for refugee minors varies, depending on need. In Massachusetts, the state Office for Refugees and Immigrants has budgeted about $3 million to serve 93 minors.
Arizona State Refugee Coordinator Charles Shipman said his state has been asked to increase its numbers from 43 to 63. Arizona can find those new foster homes, Shipman said, but it going to take some time.
&quot;You have to work to develop more homes,&quot; Shipman said. &quot;It a pretty intense process to adequately serve these kids.&quot;
Hilliard said her state has been asked to double up from 50 to 100 children. &quot;We ve already got eight more on the way,&quot; she said.
Mary Bartholomew, who oversees the Massachusetts program for Lutheran Social Services, said social workers in the state are racing to look for new homes because of the expected rise in numbers. She said some former foster parents are opening up their homes to more children.
Michelle and Peter Zimmerman, of Leicester, Mass., said they wanted their two sons, now 15 and 13, to know &quot;how blessed they were.&quot;
After taking in Liberian refugee Sam Barclays, who later joined the US Marines, Bartholomew asked the family to consider fostering two refugee brothers who had escaped a prison in Myanmar. The boys fled Myanmar where they were wrongly accused by the military government of trying to sell a car, said Lian Sian Kim, 18.
In 2008, after living in hiding in Malaysia, Kim and his brother, Lian Sian Sang, 16, arrived at the Zimmermans doorstep. &quot;It was nice,&quot; said Kim, now a student at Leicester High School. &quot;I didn t like the snow at first. But it OK now.&quot;
A few months later, Majok arrived at the home of Paul Boulanger, a 68 year old single father in Holliston, Mass., who has fostered three dozen refugee children in 30 years.
Boulanger also has teens living with him from the Congo, China and Myanmar. All are attending school, learning English and playing sports.
Gabriel Mugisha, 17, who escaped violence in the Congo with his siblings, said the only major conflict among the group is trying to decide what to eat for dinner.
&quot;Refugees come to my door. I have an empty bedroom. Why not?&quot; said Boulanger. &quot;God put them here.&quot;

Schlumberger Ltd., the world biggest oilfield services company, has agreed to purchase fellow industry player Smith International Inc. for about $11 billion in stock in a move to diversify its product offerings and better compete with rival Halliburton Co.
The deal, announced Sunday, boosts Schlumberger portfolio just as business is beginning to recover. Smith, based in Houston, makes drilling tools, bits and other products for the oil and gas industries.
Schlumberger, which has main offices in Paris, Houston and The Hague, Netherlands, slumped during the global recession that weakened energy demand and discouraged drilling operations around the world. But prices have since rebounded, and the company said in its most recent earnings report in January that its business will benefit as recovering countries burn more fuel.
Under terms of the transaction, Smith stockholders will receive 0.6966 of a Schlumberger share for each share held. Based on Schlumberger closing stock price Friday of $63.90, that values Smith shares at $44.51 each. Based on Smith 247.4 million shares outstanding, the all stock purchase is worth $11.01 billion.
The deal values Smith shares at a 25 percent premium to their closing price Thursday before reports of the companies merger talks sent Smith shares soaring. Smith CEO John Yearwood said the acquisition, which has been unanimously approved by both companies boards, is good for shareholders.
BMO Capital Markets analyst Alan Laws has said the purchase would fill in the few gaps Schlumberger has in its portfolio by adding Smith leading positions in fluids and drill bit technology. In a note to clients Friday as speculation about a possible deal swirled, Laws said the acquisition would beef up Schlumberger domestic US operations with &quot;mainstream services that are in high demand.&quot; He expects Smith Wilson distribution business will be spun out after the deal closes.
Also Friday, Deutsche Bank Securities analyst Mike Urban noted that Schlumberger already owns 40 percent of Smith drilling fluids business, M I Swaco. Full ownership of M I Swaco would fit with Schlumberger goal of being the first or second biggest player in its businesses.
Schlumberger reported profits of just over $3 billion on $22.7 billion in revenue in 2009. Smith is less than half its size but still a significant player, earning about $1 billion on revenue of $8.2 billion last year. The company employs more than 21,000 workers worldwide.
Because of overlaps in the two companies businesses, Schlumberger said it expects to see pretax savings of about $160 million in 2011 and $320 million in 2012. Earnings per share are expected to benefit starting in 2012.
Schlumberger Chairman and CEO Andrew Gould said increased levels of drilling will be required to sustain world oil and gas production. Oil companies will be challenged to drill both more economically and in more difficult, hard to reach areas. Gould said the Smith deal allows the company to merge its expertise in measurement and steering capabilities with Smith drilling fluid and bit technologies.
Smith shareholders will own about 13 percent of the combined company once the deal is completed, likely in the second half of 2010.
The acquisition comes six months after Schlumberger rival Baker Hughes Inc. struck a $5.5 billion cash and stock deal to buy BJ Services Co. a move analysts saw as likely to touch off further consolidation in the oilfield services sector.
Capital One Southcoast Inc. analyst Pierre Conner said Friday that a deal between the companies would face a lot of scrutiny from antitrust regulators. The Justice Department has issued multiple requests for information on the Baker Hughes/BJ Services deal, which is expected to close sometime in the first quarter.
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Baker Botts LLP served as financial and legal advisers, respectively, to Schlumberger. UBS Investment Bank and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz advised Smith International.

KISSIMMEE, Fla. Roy Oswalt will be counting innings more than victories this season.
The Houston Astros ace said Sunday that if he can make 35 starts and reach 200 innings, he ll consider 2010 a successful year.
Oswalt finished 2009 with a disappointing 8 6 record, a career high 4.16 ERA and a franchise record 16 no decisions. He strained his lower back in July, then sat out the last two weeks of the season with a bulging disk.
Oswalt also grew frustrated when he felt like he was taking the brunt of the blame for the team struggles, even when he pitched well. He allowed three runs or fewer in 19 of 30 starts, and took a loss or a no decision in 12 of them.
&quot;You can only do so much, you can only play as long as you can play, and that all you can do,&quot; he said. &quot;You get talked about a lot, but that part of the game.
&quot;Everybody got an opinion,&quot; he said. &quot;It been like that all my life, so it doesn t really matter. I don t have anything to prove, just go out there and pitch, if I can stay on the field, that the biggest thing.&quot;
The 32 year old Oswalt said his back is healed and he been re energized by new manager Brad Mills and pitching coach Brad Arnsberg, who ve brought a much needed fresh approach to the clubhouse.
Now if only Oswalt can stay healthy.
Oswalt met with two back specialists and followed a daily offseason exercise regimen to re strengthen his back muscles. He also got some extra time to recover and prepare for spring training, unlike last season, when he pitched in the World Baseball Classic.
If his back can hold up, Oswalt thinks he can put up similar numbers to 2004 and 05, when he helped Houston reach unprecedented postseason success. He made 35 starts and won 20 games in each of those seasons.
&quot;I usually don t set goals,&quot; Oswalt said. &quot;If I can start 35 games and feel good going out there, that pretty much all I can ask for. It all about being out there.&quot;
Mills, hired to replace the fired Cecil Cooper, said he has no reason to believe Oswalt can t regain his old form. He can t speak to what happened to Oswalt last season, and just wants his No. 1 starter to find his comfort level.
&quot;He a good pitcher, and he going to be a good pitcher for a few more years, quite a few more years,&quot; Mills said. &quot;There no reason to think that he not going to have an outstanding year. I haven t been here in the past, so I don t know exactly what gone on, how he performed. I look at numbers.
&quot;I just want Roy to be Roy, and he ll be fine.&quot;
Oswalt, left hander Wandy Rodriguez and first baseman Lance Berkman are the last holdovers from Houston 2005 World Series team. Entering his 10th season, Oswalt leads the majors with 137 wins since 2001 and he started the last seven season openers.
Despite the success, Oswalt said he won t hesitate to ask for guidance from Arnsberg, who coached current Philadelphia ace Roy Halladay in Toronto. Arnsberg and Oswalt sat down for a meeting on Sunday morning.
&quot;It doesn t matter where you are in your career,&quot; Oswalt said, &quot;you can always learn something.&quot;
Arnsberg said he won t hold back telling Oswalt about techniques or routines employed by Halladay or other top pitchers he coached. He wants to listen and learn from Oswalt, too.
&quot;It nice to be able to throw a name out there,&quot; Arnsberg said. &quot;You can always go back and reflect and say, Well, this worked for this guy. What do you say we give it a try? If we don t, well then we ll wash our hands of it and we ll go to the next stage or level. I ve got to find different ways, too.&quot;
Oswalt is just eager to get the season started and see how the rejuvenanted energy in the clubhouse translates to the field.
&quot;It is a little more exciting this year, new guys, new faces,&quot; he said. &quot;The manager brings a lot of fire to the team and the new pitching coach is really excited about bringing in some new things he had in Toronto, with what he did with Halladay up there and some different guys. It should be fun.&quot;

FORT WORTH, Texas For years, probation revocation cases involving thousands of defendants moved through the courtroom of one Texas judge with remarkable efficiency.
Robert K &quot;Bob&quot; Gill disposed of nearly 8,000 such cases in 14 years as a state district judge before his retirement in 2007. No other judge in Tarrant County handled more.
But the method he used to clear his docket, detailed in secret testimony obtained by The Associated Press, raises fairness and ethical concerns for legal experts and leads some to believe that many of the revocations could be overturned.
An attorney who regularly represented indigent probationers facing revocation in Gill court has testified that the judge personally negotiated plea deals, a role normally reserved for prosecutors. Rejecting Gill offer often meant a tougher sentence if he later heard the case and decided a violation occurred, the attorney, William H &quot;Bill&quot; Ray, said under oath.
&quot;In his court as opposed to other courts, there was no interaction with the prosecutors,&quot; Ray testified. &quot;They didn t enter into the conversation unless it became a contested matter.&quot;
Ray, a well known Fort Worth criminal defense attorney, testified at a hearing in federal court last May that was part of a case that has since been sealed. Documents from the case were obtained by the AP
The testimony suggests conduct that would violate defendants constitutional right to due process, according to some who study criminal law and judicial matters.
&quot;The judge, after all, is supposed to be a neutral referee,&quot; said John Schmolesky, a law professor at St. Mary University in San Antonio.
Attorneys who specialize in post conviction issues said Ray testimony raises the possibility that every revocation in Gill court could be challenged, although defendants who have already been denied relief on other grounds would face significant legal hurdles.
Nearly 60 percent of the probationers who wound up back in Gill court had their probations revoked, according to Tarrant County court data reviewed by the AP
Gill, who now works as a deputy chief in the Tarrant County district attorney office, said in an interview that Ray testimony, while generally accurate, was an &quot;oversimplification.&quot;
He said he made sentence &quot;recommendations,&quot; not plea deals, and only when defense attorneys asked. He said he felt comfortable doing it because he knew the cases and the probation system better than prosecutors.
&quot;To me, it was cutting out a step that was unnecessary,&quot; he said.
Gill said he saw no conflict in presiding over hearings in cases where his recommendations were rejected because hearings are &quot;a whole new ball game,&quot; often involving witnesses and new information.
He said he recused himself the one time an attorney complained.
The Tarrant County District Attorney Office was aware of what Gill was doing, said Alan Levy, chief of the criminal division. Although he acknowledged that the judge procedure was &quot;contrary to the way every other court has ever handled these cases,&quot; he said the DA office went along with it because cases moved rapidly, sentences seemed to fit the offenses and defense attorneys didn t complain.
&quot;No, (the process) was not approved by us,&quot; Levy said. &quot;But he the judge. It his court. If we were worried about our rights, I suppose we could have intervened at some point. But it wasn t our rights (being affected).&quot;
The county longtime DA, Tim Curry, died last April. He was replaced by Joe Shannon, chief of the economic crimes unit. Shannon said he had no knowledge of Gill method for handling probation revocations until the AP asked about it.
Gill procedure became an issue during a hearing on a writ of habeus corpus filed on behalf of a mentally ill woman whose probation was revoked in his court in 2007.
The woman, Sandra Wilson, contended that Ray, her court appointed attorney, was ineffective because he failed to mention her mental condition even after she tried to hang herself in her jail cell.
The focus shifted to Gill when Ray testified that Wilson received a 15 year prison sentence after she rejected a plea deal in which the judge offered 12 years.
US District Judge John McBryde later vacated Wilson sentence on the grounds of ineffective counsel. But he also noted Gill &quot;unusual procedure&quot; for sentencing and said he had &quot;serious concern&quot; that it denied Wilson due process.
A day after issuing his ruling, McBryde sealed the case, citing its &quot;sensitive nature.&quot;
In an e mail to the AP, McBryde assistant, Linda Runnels, said the judge sealed the file because it contains &quot;highly personal&quot; information about Wilson that he didn t believe the public should have access to.
Roderick White, the Fort Worth attorney who successfully argued Wilson case, declined to be interviewed, citing the sealing order. However, in an e mail, he said he is concerned &quot;for the potentially widespread federal and state constitutional rights violations inherent in Judge Gill probation revocation process.&quot;
Ray said in an interview that he disclosed McBryde ruling to Tarrant County district court judges and they have allowed him to continue representing indigent defendants on the condition that he attend a five hour seminar on mitigation.
Ray has received more than $1.3 million from court appointments in Tarrant County the last five years, the most of any attorney, according to data compiled for the AP by the county auditor.
In giving Ray most of the appointments for probation revocations in his court, Gill bypassed the rotation system, or &quot;wheel,&quot; usually used for matching attorneys with indigent defendants.
The Texas Fair Defense Act, in effect since 2001, requires counties to have an impartial system for making court appointments, but it doesn t explicitly state that probation revocations must be included. Consequently, some counties, including Tarrant, allow judges to choose attorneys for those cases.
Ray earned $710,000 from his work in Gill court between 2001 and 2007, an amount that represented 43 percent of his total earnings from court appointments, according to the auditor.

WASHINGTON Top researchers now agree that the world is likely to get stronger but fewer hurricanes in the future because of global warming, seeming to settle a scientific debate on the subject.
But they say there not enough evidence yet to tell whether that effect has already begun.
Since just before Hurricane Katrina hit Louisiana and Mississippi in 2005, dueling scientific papers have clashed about whether global warming is worsening hurricanes and will do so in the future. The new study seems to split the difference. A special World Meteorological Organization panel of 10 experts in both hurricanes and climate change including leading scientists from both sides came up with a consensus, which is published online Sunday in the journal Nature Geoscience.
&quot;We ve really come a long way in the last two years about our knowledge of the hurricane and climate issue,&quot; said study co author Chris Landsea, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration top hurricane researcher. The technical term for these storms are tropical cyclones; in the Atlantic they get called hurricanes, elsewhere typhoons.
The study offers projections for tropical cyclones worldwide by the end of this century, and some experts said the bad news outweighs the good. Overall strength of storms as measured in wind speed would rise by 2 to 11 percent, but there would be between 6 and 34 percent fewer storms in number. Essentially, there would be fewer weak and moderate storms and more of the big damaging ones, which also are projected to be stronger due to warming.
An 11 percent increase in wind speed translates to roughly a 60 percent increase in damage, said study co author Kerry Emanuel, a professor of meteorology at MIT
The storms also would carry more rain, another indicator of damage, said lead author Tom Knutson, a research meteorologist at NOAA
Knutson said the new study, which looks at worldwide projections, doesn t make clear whether global warming will lead to more or less hurricane damage on balance. But he pointed to a study he co authored last month that looked at just the Atlantic hurricane basin and predicted that global warming would trigger a 28 percent increase in damage near the US despite fewer storms.
That study suggests category 4 and 5 Atlantic hurricanes those with winds more than 130 mph would nearly double by the end of the century. On average, a category 4 or stronger hurricane hits the United States about once every seven years, mostly in Florida or Texas. Recent category 4 or 5 storms include 2004 Charley and 1992 Andrew, but not Katrina which made landfall as a strong category 3.
Outside experts praised the work.
The study does a good job of summarizing the current understanding of storms and warming, said Chunzai Wang, a researcher with NOAA who had no role in the study.
James Lee Witt, former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said the study &quot;should be a stern and stark warning that America needs to be better prepared and protected from the devastation that these kinds of hurricanes produce.&quot;
The issue of hurricanes and global warming splashed onto front pages in the summer of 2005 when MIT Emanuel published a paper in Nature saying hurricane destruction has increased since the mid 1970s because of global warming, adding it would only get worse.
Several weeks later Hurricane Katrina struck, killing 1,500 people and the 2005 hurricane season was the busiest on record with 28 named storms and seven major hurricanes. But then other scientists led by Landsea disputed the conclusions that storms were already increasing in number or intensity.
Now Landsea and Emanuel are co authors on the same paper with Knutson.
In 2007, the authoritative Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said it was &quot;more likely than not&quot; that man made greenhouse gases had already altered storm activity, but the authors of the new paper said more recent evidence muddies the issue.
&quot;The evidence is not strong enough that we could make some kind of statement&quot; along those lines, Knutson said. It doesn t mean the IPCC report was wrong; it was just based on science done by 2006 and recent research has changed a bit, said Knutson and the other researchers.
Lately, the IPCC series of reports on warming has been criticized for errors. Emanuel said the international climate panel gave &quot;an accurate summary of science that existed at that point.&quot;

AUSTIN, Texas In the California where Joe Stack started out as a fresh from college software engineer, fighting the tax man was, quite literally, a religion.
Back in the 1970s and 80s, California was not just the center of the &quot;silicon revolution.&quot; The Golden State was also a teeming hive of anti government activity, much of it aimed at the federal income tax code and the agency that enforced it the Internal Revenue Service.
Tax protesters and self styled patriots railed against exemptions granted to religious organizations, the Catholic Church in particular. They formed their own &quot;churches&quot; and invited others to join.
&quot;It sounds like he went down that same path,&quot; said Dennis Riness, who did time in federal prison for running a church styled tax shelter. &quot;And ran into the same brick wall.&quot;
Riness and most others gave up the fight. It seems Joe Stack could not, unable to let go of his hatred for a system that he felt enslaved him. After two decades of financial setbacks and professional disappointments, facing an audit in a down economy, Stack decided to strike back.
In an angry letter that rambles on for 3,000 words, the 53 year old Stack set out his grievances, attributing his failures to everything from the dot com bust to the &quot;911 nightmare.&quot; He traced the beginnings of his problems with the government back 24 years and an obscure change in the Internal Revenue Code affecting software professionals.
&quot;It has always been a myth that people have stopped dying for their freedom in this country, and it isn t limited to the blacks, and poor immigrants,&quot; Stack wrote. &quot;I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after. But I also know that by not adding my body to the count, I insure (sic) nothing will change.&quot;
He posted his manifesto on the Web site of his business last Thursday morning. A short time later, his house 20 minutes north of the Texas Capitol was ablaze. He was behind the controls of his single engine Piper PA 28: &quot;Going southbound, sir,&quot; he radioed the airport tower. &quot;Have a great day.&quot;
Impact with the black glass office building that houses offices of the IRS came moments later. Miraculously, the crash that consumed Stack killed only one other victim Vernon Hunter, 68, a Vietnam veteran and father of six who worked for nearly 30 years at the IRS Ken Hunter said if Stack had come in and talked to his father, he would have done his best to help.
&quot;My dad didn t write the tax law,&quot; he said. &quot;Nobody in that building wrote the tax law.&quot;
But Stack wasn t looking for help. Like Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, he hoped his suicidal flight would become &quot;a catalyst&quot; for fundamental change, said JJ MacNab, who has studied tax protesters for a decade.
&quot;McVeigh wasn t willing to die,&quot; said MacNab, a Maryland based insurance analyst. &quot;This guy was.&quot;
There no doubt that Andrew Joseph Stack III had his share of misery.
He told his daughter he was an orphan at age 4, when both his parents died in an auto accident, and was separated from his two brothers and sister, spending at least part of his childhood in a Catholic orphanage.
Eventually, he and little brother Harry were shipped off to the Milton Hershey School, an institution for orphaned boys founded by the Pennsylvania chocolate magnate and his wife. In college, Stack went through stints during which he survived on peanut butter and bread &quot;or Ritz crackers when I could afford to splurge.&quot;
Yet he also had advantages that others did not.
At Hershey, where he was known as Andy, Stack had it better than most of his schoolmates. Because he was in glee club and lived in one of the &quot;musical homes,&quot; he was exempt from working the morning milkings in the school dairy barns, said former classmate Mike Macchioni.
And, like all Hershey students, Stack would have left the school in 1974 with a suitcase filled with new clothes, $100 in cash and the promise of financial help for college, Macchioni said. He attended Harrisburg Area Community College from 1975 77 but did not graduate, said school spokesman Patrick M Early.
Brilliant by all accounts, hot tempered by some, Stack headed for California in the early 1980s to make his fortune in computers. It was then, he wrote, that he got his &quot;introduction to the real American nightmare.&quot;
In 1985, Stack incorporated Prowess Engineering Inc. in Corona, Calif. Papers list Stack as chief executive and financial officer, and wife first Ginger as secretary and co director.
Around this time, the budding entrepreneur had developed some kind of beef with the IRS According to his suicide letter, some friends introduced Stack to &quot;a group of people who were having tax code readings and discussions.&quot;
In those days, they weren t hard to find.
Groups such as Your Heritage Protection Association and the Church of Christ, led by disbarred attorney William Drexler, were holding forth to packed rooms, preaching the gospel of hard currency and the unconstitutionality of the tax code.
&quot;We carefully studied the law (with the help of some of the best , high paid, experienced tax lawyers in the business),&quot; Stack wrote, &quot;and then began to do exactly what the big boys were doing (except that we weren t steeling (sic) from our congregation or lying to the government about our massive profits in the name of God).&quot;
That passage rings familiar to Riness. In 1978, he and partner Michael S McGinnis founded the tax protest group &quot;TEA, an Association of Twentieth Century Patriots&quot; which claimed up to 4,000 members. The pair joined up with the Universal Life Church in Modesto, Calif., and formed their own denomination, the Church of Universal Harmony, selling church charters for up to $1,500 apiece.
MacNab is convinced after reading his manifesto that Stack likely started his own &quot;home church.&quot; He wrote that he and his friends were very careful to &quot;make it all visible, following all of the rules, exactly the way the law said it was to be done.&quot;
&quot;The intent of this exercise and our efforts was to bring about a much needed re evaluation of the laws that allow the monsters of organized religion to make such a mockery of people who earn an honest living,&quot; Stack wrote.
Riness said that exactly what he was hoping to achieve with the Church of Universal Harmony: &quot;I thought that the worst thing that would happen is that if we got so big and others got big, the code would change and they would take away tax breaks to churches,&quot; he said.
Both men would learn that wasn t the worst possible outcome.

SURPRISE, Ariz. No one ever has questioned Rich Harden stuff. His health has been a different story.
&quot;I know if he healthy he ll perform,&quot; Texas Rangers manager Ron Washington said Sunday. &quot;The big thing is to keep him healthy.&quot;
Health and Harden rarely have intersected since the right hander came up to the major leagues as a member of the Oakland Athletics in 2003. He was 5 4 in 13 starts that first season and followed it with an 11 7 campaign with 167 strikeouts in 189 2/3 innings across 31 starts in 2004.
Then the injuries came a strained left oblique in 2005, a strained back in 2006 and 2009, a sprained elbow ligament in 2006 and a strained shoulder in 2007 and 2008.
&quot;In the past it always been something,&quot; Harden said.
With the litany of injuries, the 28 year old workload on the mound has decreased: nine starts in 2006, four in 2007 and a pair of 140 plus inning seasons the past two years.
Overall, Harden has been on the disabled list seven times the past five years. Yet the potential remains. Harden has averaged 9.35 strikeouts per nine innings over the past seven seasons, more than any pitcher with at least 125 starts in that span.
After a 9 9 season in 25 starts for the Chicago Cubs last year, the Rangers signed Harden to a two year deal with a mutual option for 2011.
&quot;I was excited because I ve seen him good and he been good when he healthy,&quot; Washington said.
For the first time in a half decade, Harden has come to spring training healthy. And that has given him considerable reason for optimism.
&quot;This is the first winter in a while that I ve been able to begin the whole training program and build up strength,&quot; Harden said. &quot;Easily, this is the best I ve felt in a while.&quot;
One of the ways Harden believes he can help himself approach his career best 189 2/3 innings is by reducing his pitch count per inning.
&quot;I can pitch a lot more innings if I can get deeper in each game and be more efficient with my pitches,&quot; Harden said. &quot;Even when I have a clean inning I m still throwing a lot of pitchers.&quot;
Rangers pitching coach Mike Maddux said the higher pitch counts are a result of Harden electric stuff.
&quot;Guys who have low pitch count innings have good location but they also put the ball in play,&quot; Maddux said. &quot;Guys with good stuff, the batter can t put it in play. They just foul it off, foul it off, foul it off.&quot;
If nothing else, Harden should need little time getting back into the routine of the AL West after spending the first five plus years of his career in the division.
&quot;It nice to get back to a familiar place,&quot; Harden said. &quot;Our team going to be pretty strong.&quot;
NOTES: OF Nelson Cruz was the latest position to player to report early, joining fellow OFs Josh Hamilton and Brandon Boggs and 1B Chris Davis, among others. 2B Ian Kinsler arrived mid morning on Saturday. ... Boggs, coming off a dislocated left shoulder, has been cleared to participate fully in all drills and has performed all except sliding. ... LHP Derek Holland, who limped off the training field with a mild right knee sprain on Saturday, said the knee is feeling &quot;way better&quot; but still will have a precautionary MRI on Monday.

Every 10 years, the government mounts a colossal effort to count every single person in the United States. The snapshot of America that emerges produces a vast landscape of figures used to calculate political power as well as how much federal money flows back to local communities for everything from hospitals to schools to roads.
With so much riding on the national count, which will begin next month, it has become a focus of community leaders across the country. At a January gathering of Austin and Travis County residents working to get an accurate and complete census count on April 1, one figure leaped out: $235,980,000.
That the amount of federal money city and county officials say was left on the table as the result of a 2000 census undercount of about 16,000 county residents. Although the figure had been reported before, it was stop in your tracks news to many of the volunteers.
&quot;That was really the only message I needed to hear tonight,&quot; Austin Area Interreligious Ministries Director Tom Spencer said. &quot;The galling fact that $235 million was left on the table that will be your best weapon, our best weapon.&quot;
Although $235 million is a substantial sum, for perspective, it is less than half the Travis County budget for 2010. Still, the figure created a buzz among volunteer committees that, with the Census Bureau blessing, are working to reach out to key populations and institutions, including businesses, college students, homeless people, immigrants, Asian Americans, Latinos and African Americans. They vowed to use that nugget as a selling point.
If getting Americans to fill out the 2010 census questionnaire depends at least to some degree on appealing to &quot;what in it for me&quot; sensitivities , it is because the stakes are high. The population data determine how more than $400 billion in federal funds flow each year to states and local communities for more than a hundred services, such as school lunch programs, senior citizen centers, new construction of highways and hospitals. Smaller counts mean smaller slices of the pie.
The census count also determines winners and losers in the arena of political representation. As the fastest growing state in the nation at least 60 percent of that growth was driven by Latino population gains during the past decade Texas is expected to gain at least three congressional districts.
City of Austin demographer Ryan Robinson said the census will reflect robust growth during the past decade. Robinson projects a 2010 population of about 786,000, an increase of about 130,000 from 2000, though less than the 190,000 Austin gained in the 1990s.
The census is hardly perfect. According to Census Bureau estimates, the 2000 census missed 6.4 million people disproportionately minorities, children and the poor and counted 3.1 million people twice, largely white and affluent people. (Overcounts can occur among people who own more than one home and groups that have a higher percentage of children in college away from home.) State officials say that a census undercount in 2000 cost Texas $1 billion during the past decade.
According to an analysis of 2000 census data, more than a quarter of Texas population lives in hard to count areas, which the Census Bureau designates as having low mail in response rates and contributing factors such as minority language use, poverty, low education levels and unemployment, among other indicators. That rate put Texas behind only California among states with hard to count populations, according to the study by the Annie E Casey Foundation. And the rate is even higher in Travis County, where virtually 30 percent of the 812,280 people tallied by the census in 2000 lived in hard to count areas; Travis ranked 37th among all US counties with the highest number of people living in hard to count areas, according to the study.
Already, some analysts are questioning whether the 2010 census can improve its accuracy, even as the Census Bureau mounts an unprecedented $312 million communications campaign part of a $14 billion total budget for national advertising and for outreach in dozens of other languages. The census questionnaire itself will be available in five languages other than English: Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese.
The Census Bureau says that an estimated 134 million US households can expect to receive questionnaires in the mail beginning March 15. The bureau says the 10 question form is one of the shortest in its history and takes about 10 minutes to complete.
Gone is the old census long form, which asked dozens of questions, including ones about income and the number of bathrooms in a household, which some Americans considered invasive.
About 9,800 complete count committees across the country 329 in Texas are emphasizing the brevity of the questionnaire as part of a three point census mantra: It important, easy and safe. &quot;You have to make sure the message is simple and it credible,&quot; County Judge Sam Biscoe said last month at the opening of the Census Bureau office in Southeast Austin.
The bureau strategy to persuade Americans to fill out the census form apparently recognizes that, as Gabriel Sanchez, the bureau regional director in Dallas, said, &quot;There a general mistrust whenever the government comes around looking for information.&quot;
Biscoe sought to put such fears at ease, emphasizing that the information gleaned from the census is confidential. &quot;So if you have stuff in your background you re trying to hide immigration status, problems with the criminal justice system that your personal business,&quot; Biscoe said.
&quot;And we don t ask,&quot; Sanchez said.
Although the Census Bureau is spending record amounts for advertising and outreach, it is placing a premium as well on having local residents and familiar, trusted faces deliver the message that getting counted means the local community receives its fair share of money. &quot;The complete count committees know their communities the best,&quot; census spokeswoman Jenna Steormann said.
But at a meeting this month, local committee members said they were frustrated that they didn t know enough about the work of about 400 organizations and institutions in Central Texas that have signed partnership agreements with the census to also deliver the &quot;important, safe and easy&quot; message to the people they know best. &quot;They re doing it kind of in isolation,&quot; said Travis County Constable Bruce Elfant, a co chairman of the city county complete count committee. &quot;It not as organized as it could be.&quot;
Steormann, who was not at the meeting, said the Census Bureau could share the list of organizations with the city county committee but not their contact information because it is considered personal. &quot;The main thing to remember is that it the same message,&quot; she said of the work of the census partner organizations and the complete count committee.
&quot;Certainly, it would be helpful to have that list,&quot; Elfant said last week.
At the census office opening, Biscoe described the philosophy behind the city county committee work, saying that people who distrust government couldn t care less if elected leaders tell them it important to fill out a census form. &quot;You have to get friends, peers with whom they ve developed good, close relationships, and have them help you get the message out,&quot; said Biscoe, who with Mayor Lee Leffingwell started the committee in 2009.
Among the ideas the committee has embraced: promoting the census at community events such as Republic Day of India and the Crop Hunger Walk; doing outreach to black churches, the Urban League and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and on community radio station KAZI; placing census fliers in grocery bags; holding a student rally at the University of Texas and block walks in the West Campus and Riverside Drive neighborhoods; enlisting business partners and chambers of commerce; using Facebook and other social media; and having religious leaders deliver the census message at worship services. None has seemed too novel or obvious.
&quot;Each one reach one. That really what it all about,&quot; said County Court at Law 2 Judge Eric Shepperd, a committee co chairman.
Later, Shepperd said social organizations that help homeless and homebound people with shelter, food and basic needs are perhaps best suited to spread the message among those traditionally hard to count populations.
&quot;People trust you. You bring them food,&quot; Shepperd said.
Nehal Sanghavi, an attorney and president of the India Community Center of Austin, described the challenges of penetrating the city diverse Asian origin population. &quot;Especially when it comes to languages, we re looking at 118 different languages in India alone, and we re not even including the Asian community as a whole,&quot; said Sanghavi, who is helping organize efforts to reach fast growing Asian populations in Austin.
Trust and counting issues aside, Biscoe suggested that the census must overcome another obstacle: apathy.
&quot;People say, I want to be left alone. Well, complete that 10 question questionnaire, mail
it in and we ll see you 10 years later,&quot; Biscoe said. &quot;You can t be left alone more than that.&quot;

ARLINGTON, Texas Valdiron de Oliveira injured right shoulder seemed to get worse with each of his four turns in the Professional Bull Riders first tournament style event.
Then the Brazilian cowboy was handed the $260,000 check that went with winning the Iron Cowboy Invitational on Saturday night at Cowboys Stadium.
&quot;After getting that check, it goes back to normal,&quot; de Oliveira said through an interpreter after boosting his career earnings to $920,636 by outriding Travis Briscoe in the final of an event that started with 24 riders.
Neither finalist stayed on Code Blue for 8 seconds. De Oliveira went 4.5 seconds, while Briscoe lasted 3.6 seconds.
The top two seeds defending world champion Kody Lohstroh and JB Mauney were gone before the semifinals.
De Oliveira was one of four riders to cover two bulls. Nobody covered three. After a first round bye, he opened with scores of 88.25 and 89.5 before getting bucked on his final two rides. He stayed on Big Tex for 6.9 seconds after McKennon Wimberly held on for 6.5 with the same bull.
&quot;I don t have enough words to say how much it means,&quot; de Oliveira said.
Lohstroh had one of the strongest rides of the first two rounds, scoring an 88 on Ground Zero after missing the previous two PBR events because of an injured left elbow that eventually will require surgery.
Briscoe beat Lohstroh by a point on Smack Down.
&quot;That the chance you run is you can make a good ride and not advance,&quot; said Lohstroh, who earned the top seed as the defending PBR world champion.
Smack Down was the second bull covered by Briscoe, but he couldn t stay on any of his last three. He survived two rounds despite getting bucked because he stayed on longer than his opponent. That included the semifinals, when he rode Voodoo Child for 4.8 seconds to 3.9 seconds for Guilherme Marchi.
Briscoe had a chance to surpass $1 million in career earnings. Instead, the Edgewood, NM, cowboy settled for $40,000 as the runner up.
&quot;As fast as the setup was, I didn t have time to think,&quot; Briscoe said.
Mauney advanced on his first ride despite getting bucked in 3.7 seconds and kicked in the head on his way down. He beat his brother in law, Shane Proctor, because Proctor was bounced in just 2.8 seconds.
&quot;I expect myself to win every time I nod my head,&quot; said Mauney, who quickly disappeared to the training room after his last ride and emerged with ice on his chest and left wrist. &quot;When you don t, it a disappointment.&quot;
Of the 14 rides from the quarterfinals on, two cowboys covered their bulls de Oliveira and Wimberly, the only semifinalist without a PBR series victory.

DALLAS Jason Kidd knew his Dallas Mavericks needed a jolt in the fourth quarter, so the pass first point guard decided to take charge offensively.
Kidd scored 14 of his 21 points in the final quarter, Dirk Nowitzki had 28 points and the Dallas Mavericks held off the short handed Miami Heat 97 91 Saturday night.
With All Star game MVP Dwyane Wade missing his second consecutive game with a strained left calf, Kidd knocked down a 3 pointer with 4:21 left that gave Dallas the lead for good.
Kidd sees the season winding down and said it is time for the Mavericks, who have the fourth best record in the West, to make a push.
&quot;We had 30 games left after the All Star break,&quot; said Kidd, who is second all time in assists with 10,705. &quot;Being a veteran ballclub, we understand what at stake. So the dress rehearsal is over and we ve got to get serious.&quot;
Wade, who was the NBA Finals MVP in 2006 when the Heat beat the Mavericks, was in a suit and a protective walking boot as he watched his team five game winning streak end. Without their star on Friday, the Heat beat the Memphis Grizzlies 100 87 in double overtime.
On Saturday, Miami fizzled offensively down the stretch. The Heat scored 12 points in the third quarter and couldn t match the Mavericks offensive surge late.
&quot;It a lesson for us that regardless of whether Dwyane plays or not, our formula and game plan have to be the same,&quot; Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. &quot;Collectively, we can make each other better. But if the ball stops moving, it becomes a stagnant game for us.&quot;
Kidd scored 19 points in the second half as the Mavericks rallied from an eight point halftime deficit to beat Miami for the 12th straight time in the regular season.
Caron Butler had 20 points and Kidd had 11 assists for the Mavericks, who have won three in a row. Kidd also had three steals and is one shy of tying Scottie Pippen for fifth place on the career list.
Kidd hit all three of his shots and six of seven free throws in the fourth.
&quot;After the All Star break, he been phenomenal,&quot; Nowitzki said. &quot;He been pushing the ball and scoring.&quot;
Daequan Cook scored a season high 22 points, and Jermaine O Neal added 18 points and 13 rebounds for the Heat.
&quot;I think overall we played well without Dwyane,&quot; Miami forward Udonis Haslem said. &quot;We gave ourselves a chance to win. They just made plays and we didn t.&quot;
Kidd hit a 3 pointer that gave Dallas a 71 64 lead after three and then scored his team first 11 points of the fourth. He was one point away from tying his season high point total.
Miami Mario Chalmers drove for a layup to make it 79 79 with 4:34 left.
Kidd followed with a 3 pointer, Nowitzki hit two free throws and Brendan Haywood put back a miss to make it 86 79 with 2:57 remaining.
The Mavericks hit 9 of 10 free throws in the final minute as they increased their lead in the Southwest Division to 2{1/2} games over the San Antonio Spurs.
&quot;We had to fight and scrap to get the win,&quot; Haywood said. &quot;We didn t have the energy we needed in the first half. Dirk and (Kidd) had a great game and they really pulled us through.&quot;
Miami jumped out to a 52 44 halftime lead before Dallas rallied with a 19 5 run over the final 8:07 of the third.
Shawn Marion, who scored six points in the spurt, drove for a layup to tie it at 60. Nowitzki hit a jumper to give Dallas a 66 64 lead, and Kidd connected on a 3 pointer to stretch the lead to seven with 1:53 remaining in the third.
The Heat went 5 of 13 from the floor in the third quarter and committed six turnovers.
NOTES: Mavericks center Erick Dampier (right middle finger surgery) missed his third straight game. ... The Heat are 40 60 when Wade has missed a game in his career. ... DeShawn Stevenson, who was acquired from Washington, along with Butler and Haywood, saw his first action with the Mavericks, playing the final 25 seconds of the first half. ... Kidd banked in a shot from halfcourt, but he released it just after the halftime buzzer sounded.

PINE BLUFF, Ark. Lebaron Weathers hit a jumper as time expired in overtime to give Arkansas Pine Bluff a 57 55 victory against Prairie View A&amp;amp;M on Saturday night.
Weathers, who had 21 points for the Golden Lions (11 14, 11 3), gave his team a 55 52 lead on a 3 point shot with 50 seconds remaining, but that was quickly matched by Prairie View A&amp;amp;M Christopher Jones. Following a timeout, Arkansas Pine Bluff held the ball for 33 seconds before Weathers beat the buzzer.
Jones scored 12 points for the Panthers (13 11, 8 5), and Tim Meadows and Dorian McDaniel added 11 apiece.

HOUSTON The Indiana Pacers weren t too impressed with the new look Houston Rockets.
Danny Granger scored 36 points, TJ Ford led a second half surge and the Pacers snapped a four game losing streak with a 125 115 victory over the Rockets on Saturday night.
The Rockets, playing their first game with four new players from a three team trade, led most of the game but the Pacers rallied from nine points down to start the third quarter, led by Ford, who scored 19 of his 23 points in the second half.
Troy Murphy added 18 points and 12 rebounds for the Pacers, who improved to 7 21 on the road. Aaron Books led the Rockets with 26 points and seven assists, and Luis Scola added 25 points and 11 rebounds.
&quot;It was a big, big, big win for our team and I hope this leads to more victories,&quot; Ford said. &quot;We have to give everybody credit for this win. We paid more attention to detail and that what made the difference in the second half.&quot;
Houston wasted a 65 54 halftime lead. The Pacers used an 11 2 surge at the end of the third quarter for a brief 90 88 lead. A last second basket by David Anderson tied it at 90 going into the final quarter.
&quot;It was just a poor defensive effort on our part,&quot; Houston coach Rick Adelman said. &quot;It not about shots. I don t care about that. We scored 115 points and had 28 assists and we didn t give ourselves a chance. We aren t going to do anything if we don t have more of a defensive habit toward the defensive end of the floor.&quot;
Ford hit three straight baskets in the late third quarter charge.
&quot;The guys I had out on the court did a terrific job,&quot; Pacers coach Jim O Brien said. &quot;We were calling TJ number and Houston was having a difficult job guarding our spread offense. When we can space the court and defense the ball at a high level, then we are obviously a tough team to beat.&quot;
Houston had a 108 105 lead with 5:12 to play, but Ford hit a 3 point basket and added two more 2 point baskets for a 112 108 lead the Pacers never lost.
&quot;It was a bad defensive night for us,&quot; Rockets forward Shane Battier said. &quot;I m still trying to figure out how they scored 71 points in the second half. We just didn t make a stand at all in the second half and you re not going to win games that way.&quot;
The Rockets played their first game since acquiring Kevin Martin and Hilton Armstrong from Sacramento and Jordan Hill and Jared Jeffries from New York in a three team trade that sent Tracy McGrady to the Knicks and Carl Landry and Joey Dorsey to the Kings.
Martin, the centerpiece of the trade for the Rockets, entered the game with 5:50 to play in the first quarter. His first basket as a Rocket was a turnaround 16 foot jumper with 2:43 to go in the first quarter. He finished with 14 points, six rebounds and five assists.
&quot;The one good thing about that night is that it is over,&quot; Martin said. &quot;It was fun to get back out on the court again with everything that happened over the last couple of days but we didn t come out with a win so I m kind of disappointed in that aspect.&quot;
NOTES: The Rockets are 44 15 after the All Star break in the past two seasons. ... Scola has played in 218 consecutive games, fourth longest streak in Rockets history. Calvin Murphy is third with 220 straight games, and Elvin Hayes tops the list with 442. ... Pacers reserves Jeff Foster (sore lower back) and Tyler Hansbrough (inner ear infection) sat out the game. ... Martin was the only newcomer to play for the Rockets.

FBI investigating cruise ship death
The FBI is investigating after a 32 year old woman was found dead in her stateroom on a cruise ship.
FBI Special Agent Shauna Dunlap told the Galveston County Daily News the agency is trying to determine whether the woman death was the result of foul play.
Carnival Cruise Lines said in a statement Saturday that the body was found Tuesday.
The Carnival Ecstasy left Galveston on Monday and returned Saturday.
Special prosecutor named for Celis
Former Nueces County prosecutor Angelica Hernandez has been named special prosecutor for the April trial of Democratic fundraiser Mauricio Celis on a charge of impersonating a peace officer.
Hernandez told the Corpus Christi Caller Times that District Attorney Carlos Valdez swore her in last week. Hernandez was one of the original prosecutors in the case but resigned last year to run for a judge post.
Celis, a former law firm operator, is appealing his conviction last year for posing as a lawyer.

SEGUIN There was no revenge for Westlake on Friday night, as San Antonio Jay fought off a late rally in a 52 50 victory over the Lady Chaparrals.
Westlake junior Cherrell Mays missed a last second shot that would have sent the game into overtime, as Jay beat Westlake in the area playoffs for a second straight season. Last year, en route to an appearance in the regional finals, the Lady Mustangs ousted Westlake 45 35.
&quot;These types of games build character,&quot; Jay coach Mike Floyd said.
The game entered the fourth quarter tied 36 36 but the Lady Mustangs broke the deadlock on a three pointer by Kiara Taylor. Westlake countered with a basket by senior post Courtney Duever.
Jay and Westlake exchanged baskets again but then the Lady Mustangs went on a run to push their lead to 49 40. Jay was able to create some separation on the scoreboard because Westlake committed seven turnovers in the final quarter.
With the game seemingly out of reach, Westlake mounted a ferocious rally and a Duever basket pulled the Lady Chaparrals within 51 50, with 31 seconds remaining.
But Jay ran the clock down under 10 seconds and freshman Destiny Amezquita knocked down the second of two free throw attempts to give the Lady Mustangs a 52 50 advantage with 9.9 seconds remaining. Without a timeout to use, Westlake had to push the ball upcourt after the Amezquita free throw. Mays dribbled down the lane and found a decent shot, but the ball never found its way into the basket and the final seconds ticked off the clock.
In addition to turnovers, Westlake was haunted by foul trouble.
Hannah Coley, who keyed rallies in the third and fourth quarters, picked up her fourth foul in the third quarter and had to retreat to the Westlake bench. Duever was charged with her fourth foul in the fourth quarter and had to miss more than two minutes of action.
Jay never trailed and was paced by Amezquita, who recently took over point guard duties in the wake of an injury . Her team high 18 points included seven in the final quarter. &quot; She is one of the best freshman I ve coached and I ve been coaching for 35 years,&quot; Floyd said.
Coley led Westlake (27 7) with 21 points, and Duever added 18 .

The Woodlands had a one stroke lead over Westlake after the first round of the Girls High School State Preview at Jimmy Clay Golf Course. Taylor Kilponen shot a 2 over par 74 Friday to share the individual lead and boost The Woodlands to first in the team race at 318.
Westlake was right behind thanks to a 77 from Taylor Moreno and a 79 by Mariana Sims, two of only 11 players in the field of 120 to shoot a score in the 70s . Rounding out the top five teams were A&amp;amp;M Consolidated (326), Montgomery (327) and Allen (330).
Kilponen, who finished ninth at the UIL Class 5A championships last year, shared the first day lead with Casey Grice of A&amp;amp;M Consolidated, who was sixth at last year state tournament.
Christine Lin of Westwood stood alone in third place after a 75. Moreno was tied for fourth at 77 with Marissa Dodd of Allen and Vanesa Adarme of The Woodlands.

Bowie coach Cathie Johnson Landers has traded the best seat on the softball diamond for a grassy patch behind the outfield fence.
&quot;I can see everything out there,&quot; she said after watching Bowie lose to Waco Midway 1 0 on Tuesday in the season opener for both teams .
Johnson Landers watched as Bowie senior Amy Sundahl the heir apparent to University of Texas freshman pitcher Blaire Luna struck out 16 in eight innings, but the Bulldogs could not muster enough offense for a victory.
Instead of her customary spot in front of Bowie dugout, Johnson Landers followed the game from a lounge chair behind the left field fence. Life threw Cathie and her husband, Jason Landers, Bowie varsity volleyball coach, a curve when they learned last summer they would become parents.
Johnson Landers is scheduled to deliver triplets in March.
This will be a season of change for Johnson Landers and longtime Bowie assistant coach Rose Ruffino, who will take over the program for this season.
Ruffino, who has coached softball for 25 years at Sam Houston State, McNeese State and three high schools, had little idea she would be Bowie head coach this year. When did she learn that she might take over the team?
&quot;When I found out Cathie was having triplets,&quot; Ruffino said.
Johnson Landers due date for her triplets all girls was May 26, shortly after the softball season wrapped up. Her plans changed, however, after she experienced complications with her pregnancy in December.
Now following strict orders for extended bed rest, the former All Big 12 player at Texas will attend as many Bowie games as possible as a spectator.
Johnson Landers called all the pitches from the dugout during her six years at Bowie, the past four for Luna, an all state selection who made her Longhorns debut last week by throwing a no hitter. Behind Luna, the Bulldogs reached the Class 5A state championship game in 2008.
Ruffino has delegated the responsibility for calling pitches to Bowie assistant coach Spike Fogle, a former catcher for the school baseball team.
Replacing Luna will be the biggest challenge. The Bulldogs (1 1) will go with a pitching committee of Sundahl, senior Katy Akins, senior Jillian Guerrero and junior Jessica Campbell. Sundahl, who quit basketball to concentrate on softball, got off to a terrific start in the 1 0 loss to Midway.
With only four seniors, Bowie will rely heavily on shortstop Shay Rossow, first baseman Gina Whitacre, catcher Jamie Edwards, third baseman Kendall Wiley and utility infielder Sarah Cardona.
Ruffino played for two national championship teams at Texas A&amp;amp;M between 1980 and 1984. While her love of softball has never wavered, she grew tired of the tough personnel decisions head coaches have to make daily.
At Bowie, Ruffino said, she was comfortable being an assistant.
&quot;What I enjoy is motivating (players), bringing the feel good spirit,&quot; Ruffino said. &quot;Don t get me wrong I love competing. It breaks my heart to see alligator tears from someone you know is giving her soul and blood out on that field and isn t playing.&quot;
Landers Johnson plans to return as Bowie head coach next season, when Ruffino will switch back to her role as chief assistant. After her brief scare in December, Landers Johnson said all three babies are healthy and weigh just more than two pounds each.
Less than a week into the softball season, though, she already misses the daily grind.
&quot;It was hard to watch (the first game) and not think about things I needed to fix,&quot; Landers Johnson said. &quot;Things the team could work on. I know the (current) coaching staff is seeing the same things. In my head, though, I m thinking about things I could be doing.&quot;
She just has a different vantage point.

How do you like playing at a small school?
I love playing at Hyde Park. We are a very close team both on and off the court. The small school atmosphere is something that I enjoy because families, faculty and students get involved in all of the activities.
What is your favorite basketball memory?
My favorite basketball memory was my freshman year, when we played in the TAPPS state final . We worked hard throughout the season to get to that point.
Do you have any pregame rituals?
We go out to eat as a team prior to each game. The captains have a Bible study, and we have team prayer time. We also cheer together in the locker room and on the court before the tip off.
What is a bigger challenge keeping up with academics or staying sharp for athletics?
Academics are a bigger challenge for me. I like school, but I love basketball.
If you were to have dinner with four people in the history of the world, who would they be?
I would choose Jesus because I love him; George Strait because he is the best country music singer in the world; LeBron James because he is an amazing basketball player; and King David because he overcame so many obstacles and achieved greatness through his faith.
If you had a choice to be all state or valedictorian, which would you pick?
What the best advice anyone has ever given you?
My parents have always told me to remember who (Jesus) I represent.

It been a while but one of the nets at Westlake was finally cut down.
Free throws and a role player surprise play boosted Westlake to a 72 63 victory over Pflugerville Tuesday night. The win gives Westlake the outright District 25 5A title, its first district championship since the 2003 04 season.
The Chaparrals celebrated the victory by cutting down one of the nets in their home gym.
Westlake, which needed either a win or a Bowie loss to clinch the outright title, led by as much as 10 points in the second half but Pflugerville rallied to narrow the deficit to two points by the end of the third quarter.
Unable to gain any separation on the scoreboard in the fourth quarter, Westlake turned to its bench for the game biggest play.
Feeding off the advice of his older brother, a member of Westlake co district champion team in 2002 who told him to &quot;never share with anyone,&quot; senior guard Keaton Lancashire scored his only points of the game on a rare four point play with 3:18 remaining.
Lancashire was able to get off a successful three point attempt while also drawing a foul from Pflugerville Jordan Major. Lancashire made the ensuing free throw to push Westlake lead to 62 54.
Pflugerville was unable to get closer than five points for the rest of the game.
&quot;It was a big time in the game and we needed a big shot so I felt like I needed to make it,&quot; Lancashire said.
&quot;It great to get a district championship.&quot;
While Lancashire basket ranked high on the difficulty scale, Westlake also did a good job of making the easiest of shots, sinking 21 of 24 free throw attempts.
The Chaparrals did not miss a free throw until Cody Doolin missed an attempt with 4:33 left in the game.
&quot;We really knocked them down tonight and that was key,&quot; Doolin said.
&quot;We work really hard on our free throws but frankly, we re average. When we have to, we focus and knock them down and that was key tonight.&quot;
Pflugerville struggled throughout the game with finding consistency on offense and the Panthers also missed all four of their free throw attempts in the fourth quarter.
&quot;We just didn t shoot the ball well enough to win ,&quot; Pflugerville coach Mike Murphy said.
Doolin led Westlake with 18 points. After the game he was recognized as the school all time leading scorer.
Deon Mitchell scored 22 points to lead Pflugerville.

Haylea Jackson scored five points in the final 15.1 seconds of the fourth quarter to lead Hutto past Crockett 57 54 Tuesday in a Class 4A, bidistrict playoff game at Delco Center.
Hutto trailed 10 0 to open the game and the Hippos did not tie the game until Kayla Uptmore hit a three pointer to knot the score at 40 after three quarters.
The teams traded points as Crockett sisters Angela Beadle (24 points) and Heather Beadle (14 points) used their 6 3 height advantage to grab a combined 19 rebounds, but Jackson and the ball hawking Hippo defense decided the outcome.
&quot;They were very tall but our girls really can press the ball from baseline to baseline and we wore them down tonight,&quot; said Hutto coach Norma Sierra. The Hippos forced 35 Crockett turnovers.
Heather Beadle hit a putback bucket to give the Cougars (13 7) a 54 52 lead with 36 seconds left, but Jackson came down and hit nothing but net on a three pointer to give the Hippos a 55 54 lead with 15.1 seconds remaining.
&quot;I have always wanted to get the shot and when it happened it was unreal, it was so cool,&quot; Jackson said.
After Jackson go ahead basket Crockett struggled to get the ball upcourt and called a timeout with 5.63 seconds left. The attempted inbounds pass was stolen by Jackson, who was fouled and hit both free throws to finish with 15 points and the victory. Michel Braswell and Shelby Debord scored 13 points each for Hutto.
Hutto (18 14) will face Cibolo Steele in the area round of the playoffs.
Hendrickson 50, Dripping Springs 39: In the first game of the Delco Center doubleheader, District 25 4A runner up Hendrickson raced to a 23 0, first quarter lead, then held off Dripping Springs.
&quot;This game was the story of our season: every quarter is a new adventure for us,&quot; said Hendrickson coach Tera Hollywood.
The Tigers closed within seven points, at 35 28 in the third quarter, but came up short in their comeback.
Jordyn Johnson led Hendrickson with 18 points and Kathryn Jordan added 17. Jisele Green led Dripping Springs (22 13) with 17 points.
Hendrickson (26 7) will face the winner of the San Antonio Lanier New Braunfels Canyon game.

While her team played basketball, LBJ girls basketball coach Renee Brown played a game of poker.
Knowing coaches representing possible playoff opponents were present for the Lady Jaguars 56 35 win over Marble Falls on Monday, Brown decided not to start her team in its usual full court press, a bluff designed to keep the rest of the state guessing.
&quot;We didn t want to show the whole hand of what we normally do,&quot; Brown said.
The gamble looked like it would backfire as Marble Falls built a six point lead late in the first quarter, taking advantage of the lack of pressure from the Jaguars defense. Mustangs center Lindsay Ansley found holes inside against LBJ zone and scored six of Marble Falls 10 first quarter points. Ansley also held LBJ post duo of Alex Jones and Alexis Hyder to a combined four points in the first quarter.
But Ansley had to sit halfway through the second quarter for a rest, and with no one there to clog the paint, Jones and Hyder rattled off a combined 16 points in the quarter to give the Jaguars their first lead.
On the other end, Marble Falls couldn t crack the Jaguars zone with Ansley out, and began to turn the ball over, including twice on jump balls where a LBJ defender simply tied up the ballhandler. With the offense stagnant and Jones and Hyder finding their rhythm, Marble Falls trailed by four at halftime.
&quot;We talked about (Ansley) at halftime,&quot; Brown said. &quot;She had (12) of their 20 points so we had to pretty much wear her down. I wanted them to make the post players work to get to the basket.&quot;
Satisfied her first half bluff had cast enough doubt on her strategy, Brown went back to her press. LBJ tripled its lead while Marble Falls struggled to get the ball past midcourt. Several backcourt turnovers resulted in easy layups and the Jags outscored the Mustangs 17 6 in the third quarter.
Jones and Hyder continued their hot streak throughout the half, finishing with 20 and 18 points respectively, while Ansley scored only two of her 14 points in the second half, both off free throws.
&quot;Right now, we re working on defense,&quot; Brown said. &quot;I always told them if you can stop somebody, we ll win the game.&quot;

Ashley James grabbed 10 rebounds, blocked five shots, scored five points and had four steals. But her one assist might have been the highlight as the Stony Point Tigers defeated Vista Ridge 32 25 Saturday night to earn a state playoff berth.
The Tigers finished fourth in District 16 5A and will face top ranked Cypress Fairbanks Tuesday at 6 p.m. at the Bryan Rudder High School gym.
The Tigers led 24 22 with 1 minute, 42 seconds left, when James flipped a back door pass to point guard Zeniah Morgan for an uncontested layup .That began an 8 0 Stony Point run to give the Tigers a 32 22 lead with two seconds left.
&quot;Ashley has really worked hard and done a nice job for us on the boards, but the pass was big,&quot; Tigers coach Danny Cage said.
Morgan finished with six points and six assists.
&quot;When we play Vista Ridge we have these low scoring games,&quot; Cage said. &quot;Both teams played tough defense, and it always like this,&quot;
Post Chinwe Duru led Vista Ridge with 10 points seven in the first quarter as the Rangers took an 8 7 lead.
Duru scored a basket and free throw in the final two seconds of the game for her other points.
&quot;We did a good job of defending their post player (Chinwe), and it really made a big difference to their offense,&quot; Cage said.
Bri ana Rowland led the Tigers with seven points and five boards while Morgan scored six points . Duru had 10 points and Gabby Moore eight for the Rangers.

DEL VALLE Rodney Lee sprinted behind the Del Valle bench, reached into a black gym bag and grabbed a trophy that will soon enter the Del Valle trophy case, after a 74 63 victory over Manor on Friday helped the Cardinals clinch the District 17 4A title. It is the second straight district championship for Del Valle (25 5).
&quot;This is two years in a row that we ve won district and Del Valle hasn t done that in a long time,&quot; Lee said. &quot;This feels good. It feels good like going to church on Sunday.&quot;
Del Valle, the second ranked team in this week American Statesman basketball poll, built a 10 point lead midway through the second quarter.
But the Mustangs stormed back and after scoring three times off three consecutive Del Valle turnovers, Manor pulled within three and forced a Cardinal timeout.
Del Valle scored after its timeout, but Manor, fueled by three three pointers, closed out the quarter on a 10 3 run and led 29 27 at the half.
&quot;This is our rival in our district, they re always coming for us,&quot; Del Valle senior Jozef Cortez said. &quot;There were mistakes we don t usually make. It was mental lapses on our part.&quot;
Manor momentum carried over into the second half as the Mustangs hit their first three shots and a pair of free throws in the third quarter opening minutes. Del Valle missed six of its first seven shots of the second half with its lone points on a Bralyn Thomas dunk.
Del Valle snapped out of its shooting funk and rallied to take a one point lead into the fourth quarter. Manor took the lead back on its first possession of the quarter, on a basket by LD Williams.
After Cortez scored five straight points to give Del Valle a lead it wouldn t relinquish, Lee delivered a punishing blow to the Mustangs. The reigning district MVP, who had been held scoreless in the first half, scored eight points in less than a minute to give the Cardinals an insurmountable 59 49 lead with 5:25 left in the game.
&quot;I did what I had to do,&quot; said Lee, who scored 13 points before fouling out. &quot;I d been in a slump for a while and now I m on my game.&quot;
Manor was not able to get closer than six points after that. Williams scored all but four of Manor 18 fourth quarter points and had a game high 35 points total.
Thomas had 22 points to lead Del Valle, while Cortez added 19.

ELGIN Seventeen years ago, Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake were known only as Mouseketeers, and Bill Clinton had recently been inaugurated as the 42nd president of the United States. The Dallas Cowboys had just won the first of three Super Bowl championships in a four year span, and &quot;Jurassic Park,&quot; &quot;Mrs. Doubtfire&quot; and &quot;Philadelphia&quot; were some of year top movies.
1993 also was the last time that the Elgin girls basketball team participated in a playoff game until this season.
Elgin (15 17) will play Huntsville on Tuesday in a bidistrict playoff matchup. It will be the team first postseason game since Feb. 23, 1993, when the Lady Wildcats lost 83 33 to Mont Belvieu Barbers Hill in the second round of the Class 3A playoffs.
&quot;It a very exciting thing for us,&quot; said Jasmine Simmons, the Lady Wildcats leading scorer at 10.4 points a game. &quot;I ll come back here in a few years, and I can say that this was my class that went to the playoffs.&quot;
&quot;It really cool to be a part of this dream that everybody has been waiting for,&quot; said senior forward Desarae Couthren .
After winning the District 21 3A title in 1993, the Elgin girls basketball program fell into obscurity. And even within the athletic department at Elgin, which became a Class 4A school in 2004, the Lady Wildcats were stuck in the shadows of the school other sports.
A state semifinalist in 2005, the Elgin softball team has reached the second round of the playoffs in each of the past 12 years . Elgin alum Will Rivers still owns the state swimming record in the 500 yard freestyle. And the Elgin football team has posted four eight win seasons in the past 10 years, while the boys basketball squad has made three straight trips to the playoffs.
The success, however, did not trickle down to the girls basketball team.
When Jackie Bowman, a former assistant at Beeville, came to Elgin in 2005, he inherited a basketball program that had only 14 players . That number has swelled to 35 this season, and the Lady Wildcats will suit up 15 players Tuesday.
&quot;I don t think most of them think about the history; I think most of them want to play basketball,&quot; Bowman said. &quot;The ones that are here, it because they love basketball.&quot;
The Wildcats returned four starters this season, and the roster boasts five members of the class of 2010, the largest senior presence during Bowman tenure.
The players credited better chemistry as a reason for their success, while Bowman pointed to a tougher non district schedule.
The team turnaround likely came in a victory over Manor in December. Beating Manor, a regional quarterfinalist last season, gave the Lady Wildcats a needed confidence boost.
&quot;I always believed that we could do it, but (it was) the part of actually doing it that was harder than everybody thought,&quot; Couthren said.
Before the season, the Elgin basketball players wrote out their goals, one list for themselves and another for the team. Almost unanimously, the players jotted down a trip to the playoffs as a team goal.
A few months later, the Lady Wildcats are setting new goals.
&quot;We re happy that we got there, but we want to succeed and win a game,&quot; Simmons said.

As a player for Dripping Springs, which team do you consider your No. 1 rival?
In the past, it always been Lake Travis. This year, I personally want to beat LBJ the most.
What is your favorite basketball memory?
It was when my select team, Austin Glory, caravaned to Memphis over the summer for a basketball tournament. We had a blast hanging out with each other and we went to this barbecue place. I can t remember what it was called, but it was amazing.
Do you have any pre game rituals?
I always have a little thing that I put in my water bottle called Zipfizz (an energy drink powder). Sometimes I ll listen to music.
Which is a bigger challenge keeping up with academics or staying sharp for athletics?
Keeping up with academics is definitely a bigger challenge for me.
If you were to have dinner with any four people in the history of the world, who would they be?
First, I would choose Taylor Swift because she is young and successful. Then I d have Dan Brown because he has written some awesome books, like &quot;Angels and Demons.&quot; I d invite Rajon Rondo (of the Boston Celtics) because he is amazing at basketball and (Texas volleyball and track and field star) Destinee Hooker because she is also amazing.
Outside of athletics, what do you enjoy most about Dripping Springs High School?
Seeing my friends everyday in school.
If you had a choice to be all state or valedictorian, which would you pick?
What the best advice anyone has ever given you?
I was doing a project where I had to use quotes. From an author that was unknown, I read, &quot;If you want your dreams to come true, don t oversleep.&quot;
If you bought a car that best matched your personality, what would it be?
I really like fast, sporty cars. I would probably pick a Shelby GT Cobra Mustang.
If you could take a vacation anywhere, where would you go?
I would go on a cruise through the Caribbean.

The 57 year old Carson was 33 40 at Seguin. The Matadors made the playoffs three times under Carson, winning the District 25 5A championship in 2006. Last season, Seguin was 2 8.
After two years at the Class 4A level, Seguin jumped back to 5A earlier this month.
McCallum football team has been named the Class 4A US Army Strong Team of the Year, and the Knights will be honored on Feb. 26 inside the school fieldhouse.
This past season, the Knights finished 9 3, won the District 26 4A championship and advanced to the third round of the playoffs for only the second time in school history. McCallum success came in the wake of the death of longtime head coach Pat Honeycutt, who died of a heart attack in January 2009.
Honeycutt was succeeded by Todd Raymond, a 1991 graduate of McCallum who was an assistant coach under Honeycutt for six seasons.
The US Army Strong Team awards are presented in partnership with TexasFootball.com.
On Feb. 20, the Championship Hearts Foundation will perform free heart screenings for athletes between the ages of 14 and 18 from 8 a.m. to noon at the Heart Hospital of Austin, 3801 N Lamar.
Athletes will be checked for a genetic disorder called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , which causes a thickening of the heart wall. The leading cause of sudden cardiac death in young people, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy affects roughly one in 500 people.
The screenings typically take about five minutes, and no appointment is necessary. Signed parental waivers are required for a student to be screened. Waivers can be found online at www.championshipheartsfoundation.org.

A Williamson County grand jury Tuesday indicted on two felony counts the father of an 18 month old boy who was forgotten in the family mini van and died after more than six hours in the August heat.
Kesen Hu, 34, faces charges of criminally negligent homicide and endangering a child, both of which carry up to two years behind bars.
Hu was arrested within days of his son death but later released on bail.
He and his attorney have said that what happened in the parking lot of a Northwest Austin office complex on Aug. 12 was a fatal oversight but did not constitute a crime.
According to a two page indictment, Hu, through an act of omission, put his son &quot;in imminent danger of death&quot; by &quot;confining Daniel Hu in a motor vehicle and exposing him to heat dangerous to human life.&quot;
Hu used several deadly weapons a car, a car seat and heat to carry out his crime, the indictment said.
&quot;I felt confident the conduct here was covered by the Texas penal code,&quot; Williamson County District Attorney John Bradley said. &quot;At the same time, I think we all have tremendous sympathies for the plight that the defendant is involved in the death of his son.
&quot;But at the same time, the facts are the facts.&quot;
Bradley added that both charges include probation as a possible sentence.
Attorney Alan Bennett, who is representing Hu, declined to comment Tuesday night. He said he had not had a chance to review the indictment or speak to his client.
Daniel death received further attention last summer after police confirmed that a woman had seen Daniel earlier in the day when he was still alive and reported it to a security guard.
Police have said that the guards made an effort to find Daniel but could not.
Bradley and Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo also publicly criticized each other handling of the case. Daniel died in a part of Austin that is in Williamson County.
Bradley said Austin police were hesitant to charge Hu.
Acevedo said that Bradley tried to bully investigators into charging Hu, even though their inquiry was not yet finished and they were unsure they had evidence to support a case. Bradley then moved ahead with a case.
On Tuesday, Acevedo said investigators had diligently investigated the death.
&quot;There is a process in place, and the process occurred, and now it is up to the district attorney and the jury,&quot; Acevedo said.
In a September interview, Hu told the American Statesman that he did not typically take Daniel to day care each morning but was doing so that day to allow his wife to run errands.
That morning, he said, he followed his usual route to work as a software engineer at PayPal Inc.
He said that as he neared his parking lot and a turn toward Daniel day care, he received a phone call from a company claiming that he owed money for his power bill. He had already checked to make sure his payment was up to date after a previous call and said he was annoyed the company was again calling him.
Distracted by the call, Hu said that he pulled into his parking lot, instead of going toward Daniel day care, got out of the minivan and went to work.
He said that he did not remember that he d forgotten to drop Daniel off until about 4 p.m., at which time he raced to the van and found his son dead.
According to a 2007 Associated Press report, a review of more than 300 fatal cases nationally in which children were forgotten in cars showed that prosecutions and penalties varied widely.

Round Rock city officials recommended Tuesday that four way stop signs be installed near where 12 year old Shaylah Dame was fatally struck by two cars last month.
The signs could be placed at Gattis School Road and Windy Park Drive as early as Feb. 26 if the City Council supports the recommendation.
The council is required to take two votes on the installation of stop signs. The first vote is scheduled Thursday, and the second vote would be Feb. 25.
Transportation services staff members have recommended that, ultimately, a traffic signal and crosswalk be placed at the intersection but said that the design, engineering and construction for those could take 10 months, city spokesman Will Hampton said.
&quot;It seems like a really good plan,&quot; neighbor Jodee King said after the city announcement Tuesday. &quot;The city seems to be trying to do it in a timely manner, and we re real pleased.&quot;
Neighbors and Dame parents met with city representatives and held a rally after the accident asking for a crosswalk.
Shaylah, a sixth grader at CD Fulkes Middle School, was hit just before 7 p.m. Jan. 28 in the 1800 block of Gattis School Road while walking home from a skate park behind the Clay Madsen Recreation Center. Witnesses told police she ran south, midblock, in front of traffic and was struck by a westbound Toyota sedan driven by a Hutto woman.
That woman, whose name has not been released, stopped at the scene and does not face charges. A second driver, Faith Elizabeth Davis, 21, of Pflugerville, also struck Shaylah but left the scene, police said. She has been charged with failing to comply with requirements for an accident involving personal injury or death, a third degree felony that carries a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison.
City transportation staff members studied the traffic in the area last week and found that during a 24 hour period, 1,758 vehicles entered the east driveway of the recreation center, compared with the 908 vehicles in a 2004 study, Hampton said. The east driveway is at the intersection where the stop signs would be placed, Hampton said.
The traffic at the recreation center has probably increased since 2004 because of the construction of the skate park and because a left turn lane was installed on Gattis School Road at the recreation center, Hampton said.
Last week traffic study also found that Gattis School Road had less traffic on it 24,814 cars during a 24 hour period than in the 2004 study, when it had 25,670 vehicles, Hampton said. Drivers have alternative routes now because of the construction of Texas 45 and the extension of AW Grimes Boulevard to US 79, Hampton said.

Williamson County officials said they have charged four members of the Aryan Brotherhood, a white supremacist group, in connection with the kidnappings of three people who were assaulted last week in a mobile home near Leander. The assaults were not part of a robbery attempt and were not related to drugs or race, but investigators have declined to release a motive, said John Foster, a spokesman for the Williamson County sheriff department.
Samuel Cory Sikes, 32, Anthony C Almeida, 27, Kevin Brandon Radford, 26, and Andrew Dominick Stellitano, 25, have been charged with engaging in organized crime aggravated kidnapping. Radford also has been charged with evading arrest, Foster said.
The victims, two men and one woman, were white, Foster said. They have been released from the hospital, he said. They were all kicked, struck with fists and beaten with a blunt object, he said.
One of the victims also was a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, an arrest affidavit said. He told investigators that Sikes and some other people, including another one of the victims, picked him up from a house in Kingsland on Thursday, and they went to a mobile home at 4401 Oak Creek Road, the affidavit said.
At one point in the evening, as the victim got out of a truck to go to another mobile home on the same property, he said Sikes and Radford confronted him and he was struck with an unknown object, the affidavit said.
The victim said he was bound around the wrist and ankles with plastic zip ties, hit repeatedly and then moved into the home where he had been heading, the affidavit said. In the home, he saw the female victim sitting on a couch with her hands behind her back and her mouth gagged, the affidavit said. The victim said he was then dragged into another room and beaten again, the warrant said.
The kidnappers threw the two male victims into the back of a truck and left the female in the mobile home early the next morning, Foster said. One of the male victims, who was still bound, jumped out of the truck on RM 2243 at Bagdad Road and notified authorities, Foster said.
The kidnappers did not notice the man was missing until they pulled into a park off Bagdad Road , he said. They then released the other victim, Foster said. A SWAT team from the sheriff department rescued the female victim from the home.
Investigators received several tips about the locations of the kidnappers, Foster said.
Police arrested Sikes and Almeida on Friday, he said. Radford was arrested at 3:30 a.m. Saturday after a foot chase on Manchaca Road in South Austin, Foster said, and Stellitano was arrested in the same area.
The men told officials they were members of the Aryan Brotherhood and had tattoos that identified them as members, Foster said.
He said it was not common for the sheriff department to arrest suspects involved in the gang. Radford, Almeida and Sikes were being held Monday night at the Williamson County Jail. Bail for Almeida and Radford was set at $400,000 each. Bail for Sikes was set at $650,000. Stellitano was being held Monday at the Travis County Jail, with bail set at $500,000.

The Williamson County district attorney and a jury stood up against the Ku Klux Klan in 1923 but Chris Dyer, director of the Williamson Museum, says not enough people know about it.
That why the museum in Georgetown opened an exhibit Friday focused on the 1923 trial that resulted in the conviction of several Klan members who assaulted a traveling salesman.
&quot;This trial had a very positive impact, and we wanted to cover it,&quot; Dyer said.
The trial was spurred by an incident that started in the spring of 1923, when a Baptist preacher, the Rev. AA Davis, delivered a letter to the traveling salesman, Robert Burleson, said Lisa Worley, the curator of the museum who researched the event. The letter, with a seal on it from the Georgetown Ku Klux Klan, accused Burleson of having an affair with a widow, Fannie Campbell, who ran the boardinghouse where Burleson was staying, Worley said. Both Burleson and Campbell were white; the Klan objections hinged on alleged immorality.
The letter told Burleson to leave town, but he refused, Worley said. Burleson was in a car with Campbell and some of her relatives on Easter Sunday 1923 when four Klan members, who had not disguised themselves, pulled him out and pistol whipped him in front of the car passengers, she said.
They threw him in the back of a truck, took him elsewhere and stripped him and beat him with a leather strap before padlocking him to a tree on the front lawn of the Taylor City Hall and pouring tar over his head, she said.
Burleson, who was in his 20s, managed to escape and crawled to a nearby house, Worley said. He spent a week in the hospital recovering from his wounds.
Williamson County District Attorney Dan Moody, who was later elected Texas governor, decided to try the case with a team of prosecutors from his office. The defense closing argument lasted 6 hours and 45 minutes. The jury deliberated only 15 minutes before convicting the ringleader, Murray Jackson, of assault with a prohibited weapon. They sentenced Jackson, a 26 year old member of the Taylor Volunteer Fire Department, to five years in prison. The other men involved, Olin Gossett, Dewey Ball and Godfrey Loftus, were all sentenced to one year in prison, Worley said.
&quot;A perjury conviction against the Klan preacher (AA Davis), who instigated the incident,was especially important because Moody convinced six Klansmen to testify against their fellow Klansman,&quot; said Williamson County District Judge Ken Anderson, who has written two books about Moody. &quot;Thus the secrecy of the Klan was also destroyed.&quot;
The Williamson County district clerk office has the original papers from the trial. A reproduction of them, including the jury verdict in the Jackson trial, will be displayed in the new exhibit, which will be in place for a year.
The exhibit also includes a Klan robe made about 1910, on loan from the Witte Museum in San Antonio. A list of the jurors in the trial, photos of the courtroom and the prosecutors, and material explaining the trial and the Klan involvement in Texas will also be on display.
&quot;The 1920s Klan was in political power in Texas and controlled a lot of elections,&quot; Dyer said.
&quot;The Williamson County jury in the 1923 trial was probably scared and knew Klan members, but they stood up and did the right thing at their own personal risk.&quot;

ROUND ROCK The sun glinted off children bicycles decorated with purple and gold garlands, balloons, ribbons and red hearts on Friday as more than 300 students at Sommer Elementary School celebrated the kickoff of a program encouraging them to bike to school.
Volunteers gave each child a free bike helmet, donated by the Austin Cycling Association, with a microchip attached to it. The chips help transmit the number of rides a child takes. A radio frequency scanner powered by a solar panel and mounted on a large pole outside the school will read the chips and send the information to an Internet database.
Students will receive awards based on how many times they ride to school, including tickets to a raffle for a free bike.
It all part of a national nonprofit program Freiker, short for frequent biker that uses technology to encourage children to exercise, said Leslie Luciano , director of advocacy for Bicycle Sport Shop in Austin. Sommer is the first school in Texas to try the program, she said.
The school was chosen because the neighborhood around it has plenty of sidewalks and is a safe area for children to bicycle, said Mark Pratz , the school principal. About 700 of the school 1,008 students live close enough to bicycle to school, Pratz said. Students who don t live close enough can participate by having their parents record the distance they ride at home.
&quot;I think it great, and it a way to jump start your kids into riding to school,&quot; said Nancy Siefert, a parent who was at the parade Friday with
her 10 year old twins, Ashlyn and Kylie.
She said there are too many cars dropping children off at school. &quot;The traffic here is just atrocious.&quot;
The bike program is part of a larger push for physical education at schools across Texas, said Jen Ohlson, the director of a program called &quot;All About Health,&quot; which uses technology during the school day including heart rate monitors during PE classes to encourage children to take care of themselves. Sommer students are already using the heart rate monitors, she said.
The children who showed up for the event Friday didn t seem to need any encouragement.
&quot;I think it fun to ride your bike; it just the joy of it,&quot; 8 year old Jason Schneider said. Riding to school in the morning is something to look forward to, he said. &quot;You actually get to get up early,&quot; he said.
Braden Olson, also 8, chimed in. &quot;You get a chance to exercise and to strengthen your legs.&quot;

Police arrested a woman Tuesday who is accused of leaving the scene last week after hitting a 12 year old girl who had been struck by another vehicle on a busy Round Rock street.
Faith Elizabeth Davis, 21, of Pflugerville is charged with failing to comply with requirements for an accident involving personal injury or death. The third degree felony charge carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Her bail has been set at $75,000. She turned herself in to police Tuesday and remained in jail Tuesday night.
Shaylah Dame, a sixth grader at CD Fulkes Middle School, was crossing the 1800 block of Gattis School Road when she was hit by a car about 6:50 p.m. Thursday, police said. Shaylah died at a local hospital a short time later. The driver of that car, a woman from Hutto, stopped at the scene and does not face charges, police said.
A witness saw a second car hit the child but did not remember a possible license plate number until the next day, said Eric Poteet, a spokesman for the Round Rock Police Department.
The plate number that the witness provided was only partially correct, but police experimented by changing a letter and were able to trace the car to Davis, Poteet said.
On Friday, police found the car, a 2005 Dodge Neon, outside the South Austin medical office where Davis works as a clerk, Poteet said.
When officers interviewed Davis, she told them she had seen the first vehicle hit the girl and had been unable to avoid striking her. Davis told officers she got out of her car and &quot;observed the child laying in the road,&quot; according to an arrest warrant.
Davis told police she left the scene because she was driving with a suspended license, the warrant said. Her license was suspended because of a failure to pay insurance, Poteet said.
Funeral services for Shaylah were Tuesday.
Before the collision, Shaylah had asked her father permission to go the skate park behind the Clay Madsen Recreation Center, but he had told her no, Poteet said. She had never gone alone to the skate park before or crossed the road to get there, her older sister said last week. Peyton Dame said their father, Charles Dame, always drove them to the park.
Neighbors rallied near the scene Saturday asking the city for a crosswalk on Gattis School Road.
The city last studied the area in 2005 and determined that the intersection did not meet the criteria for a crosswalk. The city is conducting an engineering study again this week to see whether the traffic congestion at Gattis School Road and Windy Park Drive now merits a crosswalk.

Williamson County prosecutors announced Monday that they will seek the death penalty in the case of a man accused of killing a 9 year old girl at her Cedar Park home last year.
Rone Nunez, 24, rejected a deal Monday to plead guilty to super aggravated sexual assault of a child, a first degree felony, in exchange for a sentence of life without the possibility of parole.
District Judge Billy Ray Stubblefield set a trial date for Sept. 27.
Nunez was indicted in August on six counts, including capital murder and super aggravated sexual assault of a child, in the April 25 death of Cecilia Margarita Izquierdo Vallina.
Williamson County District Attorney John Bradley declined to comment on the case.
If Nunez had accepted the plea deal, he would have been spared the possibility of a death sentence if convicted of capital murder.
&quot;It a very difficult decision,&quot; Nunez attorney Steve Brittain said. &quot;But that Mr. Nunez choice. It his life, and we just want to give him enough information that he is able to make the choice that suits him.&quot;
Nunez, who is a Honduran national, is accused of slashing Cecilia throat with a &quot;knife or unknown object, in the course of committing or attempting to commit aggravated sexual assault or kidnapping,&quot; according to the indictment.
Nunez rented a room in a house in the 2100 block of East Riviera Drive and lived with the girl family, but he was not related to family members, officials said.
Cedar Park police initially ruled Cecilia death an accident by electrocution when family members found her unresponsive in the backyard about 3:30 p.m. April 25.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. Endeavour and its six astronauts dropped out of orbit and zoomed toward a rare nighttime landing Sunday to end a mission that resulted in the virtual completion of the International Space Station.
The weather almost didn t cooperate. All day, forecasters said rain and clouds might scuttle any touchdown attempts. But the rain stayed away and the sky cleared as the evening wore on.
Mission Control waited until the last possible minute before giving commander George Zamka the go ahead to head home.
&quot;It a great night to land in Florida,&quot; Mission Control radioed. Zamka was told to expect some thin decks of clouds, but nothing more.
This was to be the 23rd space shuttle landing in darkness, out of 130 flights. The last time was in 2008 by Endeavour.
During their mission which spanned two weeks and 5.7 million miles the astronauts delivered and installed a new space station room and a big bay window with sweeping views of the Earth.
The new room, Tranquility, will serve as a base for life support equipment, as well as a gym and restroom. It also holds the seven windowed dome, quite possibly the most anticipated addition ever made to a spacecraft.
The 10 men and one woman on the shuttle station complex couldn t get enough of the views out those windows, once the shutters were raised last week.
The two new compartments were supplied by the European Space Agency at a cost of more than $400 million. Their addition brought the 11 year old space station to 98 percent completion.
All that left now are four shuttle flights to stock the space station with more experiments, spare parts and supplies. Discovery will make the next trip in early April.
NASA plans on wrapping up the shuttle program this fall, after which the space station will be supplied by craft from Russia, Europe and Japan. The Obama Administration is proposing that commercial rocket companies take a crack at the US ferry side of it, once the three remaining shuttles are retired.
Over at the space station, meanwhile, computer trouble triggered temporary communication blackouts Sunday.
The station three command and control computers kept malfunctioning throughout the morning, disrupting communication between the crew and Mission Control. Until full contact was restored in late afternoon, the five astronauts had to make do without e mail and their Internet Protocol phone.
Flight controllers suspect the trouble may be related to computer software in Europe Columbus laboratory.
To make up for all the inconvenience, Mission Control is giving the crew Wednesday off.

TYLER Two men who once attended church together were charged Sunday with burning down a church in East Texas, and they are suspected in a string of similar blazes, authorities said.
Jason Robert Bourque, 19, and Daniel George McAllister, 21, face one count each of felony arson for a church fire in rural Smith County near Tyler, said Tom Crowley, spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
Bail is set at $10 million apiece. They could face life in prison if convicted.
&quot;Because they are charged with one doesn t mean they re not going to be charged with some of the others,&quot; Crowley said.
Crowley and Smith County jail officials said they had no information on attorneys for either men.
Bourque, of nearby Lindale, was arrested early Sunday in Van Zandt County, site of four of the 10 church fires in East Texas this year that authorities think were intentionally set, Crowley said.
McAllister was taken into custody in San Antonio, where Crowley said he had recently moved.
He said Bourque and McAllister used to attend First Baptist Church in McAllister hometown of Ben Wheeler.
The arrests were triggered by a telephone tip, although the two had been on authorities radar for several weeks, Crowley said.
One of the men was linked to the fire with DNA evidence, Crowley said. He said he had no other details. Officials declined to discuss a motive at a news conference Sunday. No injuries have been reported in the fires.
The outbreak started with a blaze at a church in Athens, and Crowley said another New Year Day fire not far away has been added to the list of 10 suspected arsons in East Texas. A fire in Temple brings to 11 the statewide total of fires authorities think are attributable to arson.
Authorities have said the federal investigation kicked in after two churches burned Jan. 11 in Athens. Less than a week later, four fires in five days were reported. The two most recent fires included the one that resulted in charges against Bourque and McAllister.
&quot;This investigation is not complete. But today marks a significant milestone,&quot; said Robert Champion, the ATF agent in charge in Dallas.
The Rev. David Mahfood, pastor of one of the Tyler churches that burned, said word of the arrests &quot;puts a period on the paragraphs of our lives&quot; but said residents still will remain vigilant.
&quot;We re blessed that no lives were lost and no one was injured, but I don t think we let our guard down,&quot; Mahfood said.

SAN MARCOS For some people, a painting is just a painting, an image to be admired on a wall somewhere.
But for Don Olson, a painting can be a mystery to be solved.
It why the Texas State University physics professor and his students traveled to Asgardstrand, Norway, in 2008 to solve the puzzle behind Edvard Munch &quot;Starry Night.&quot;
Using Google Earth, surveying equipment, maps and pictures, they tracked down the coastline vantage point Munch used in 1893. And with astronomical calculations and weather records, they determined the date it was painted and identified the celestial bodies depicted something that had never been done before.
Olson has also helped decipher some of the passages of the Canterbury Tales, discovered the exact location and time of a famous Ansel Adams photograph and helped shed new light on two controversial battles in World War II
He calls his work &quot;forensic astronomy,&quot; and he is perhaps the foremost practitioner of a science that blends history, art and literature with star charts, maps, tidal information and mathematics.
Olson whose office is stacked with books, paintings, robot toys and an inflatable &quot;The Scream&quot; doll said his work is about finding challenging projects and getting his undergraduate and graduate students involved in science, art and world travel.
The Van Gogh painting &quot;White House at Night&quot; depicts a white house with a reddish roof, three women in black dresses walking near the front gate and a ball shaped light shining overhead. The casual observer might think the light is the moon or the sun.
Olson and some students went to Auvers sur Oise, France, in 2000 and tracked down the house. They examined the angles of the home, weather records and Van Gogh letters to his brother around the time of the painting, and using computer programs and astronomical data, came to a different conclusion: &quot;That the planet Venus,&quot; Olson said.
&quot;Venus was above that house, and it was dazzlingly bright,&quot; he said. In addition, they know where and when, down to the hour when Van Gogh created the painting. &quot;We can claim we can stand where Van Gogh was within 10 feet.&quot;
The 63 year old Olson has taught at Texas State since 1981. He calls his lectures &quot;sermons,&quot; often goes off on tangents and speaks with tremendous enthusiasm about his work.
Olson in 2007 was the first recipient of the university Joann Cole Mitte Faculty Grant for Excellence, a competitive $25,000 research award given by the Mitte Foundation of Austin.
Through his wife, Marilynn, an English professor at Texas State, Don Olson met Edgar Laird, an English professor who asked him to look into some of the astronomical and tidal references in Canterbury Tales, the 14th century book of stories written by Geoffrey Chaucer.
Chaucer put a surprising amount of accurate astronomy into his works, allowing Olson to determine when some of the stories took place, he said.
Not long after, professor and Marine veteran, James Pohl, asked Olson to examine what happened during the US invasion of the Japanese held atoll of Tarawa in 1943. Marines suffered heavy losses after their landing craft struck a coral reef. US forces won the battle, but more than 3,400 Americans died. Historians had often wondered exactly what went wrong.
Olson research found that on the morning of the battle, the tide failed to rise. A quarter moon had coincided with a lunar apogee when the moon is furthest from the Earth in its orbit drastically weakening the tide. Such an event happens there only twice a year. The Marine command did not anticipate the tide failure.
&quot;It was just bad luck,&quot; Olson said.
He later used similar methods to help explain what happened to the USS Indianapolis cruiser when it was sunk by a Japanese submarine in 1945. Many war historians wondered exactly how the Indianapolis was sunk, and Olson determined the bright, rising moon made the ship silhouette visible to the sub that night, Olson said.
The Japanese submarine surfaced right after moonrise, and with binoculars, lookouts were able to see the Indianapolis on the horizon, Olson said. The submarine launched six torpedoes, sinking the ship and killing 300 men. Another 900 men were cast into shark infested waters, and only 317 of them survived. It is the greatest single loss of life at sea in the history of the US Navy, he said.
&quot;As soon as they were spotted against that rising moon, the ship was lost,&quot; Olson said.
Olson and his students looked at the ship schedule, time zone charts, calendars, radio messages and other primary sources to determine exactly where and when the ship was struck that night.
&quot;I like to involve students in what I do,&quot; he said. &quot;That the mission of the university. We re here to be teachers.&quot;
Ava Pope, a senior majoring in physics, was among those who went to the resort town of Asgardstrand to research the &quot;Starry Night&quot; puzzle. &quot;We got to go all around the town to try and figure it out,&quot; she said.
Pope said the point is to build on the work of art historians and other academics, adding new details that weren t previously known, not to overshadow or refute what they ve done. &quot;It not about proving people wrong, but making history right.&quot;
Olson has written about 30 papers, has been featured in several magazine and newspaper articles, and hopes to write a book someday. But the next project on his list is analyzing the works of poet and essayist Walt Whitman, who often wrote about the sky.
For example, in &quot;Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,&quot; Whitman wrote: &quot;From under that yellow half moon late risen and swollen as if with tears....&quot;
Where and when did he write it? What did he see that inspired him?
&quot;God, I love this stuff!&quot; Olson said.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. Space shuttle Endeavour and its six astronauts are back on Earth.
The shuttle landed at Kennedy Space Center in Florida late Sunday night, wrapping up a successful two week mission. During their visit to the International Space Station, commander George Zamka and his crew installed a new room and big bay window. The addition marked the virtual completion of the orbiting outpost.
The weather almost didn t cooperate. All day, clouds threatened to keep the shuttle in orbit. But the sky finally cleared, and Mission Control gave Zamka permission to make a rare nighttime landing.
It marked the 23rd landing for a space shuttle in darkness. The last one was in 2008, by Endeavour as well.
Only four shuttle flights remain.

Published: 9:51 p.m. Sunday, Feb. 21, 2010
Plans to reopen the US 183 frontage road near the site of last week plane crash have been delayed indefinitely, a Texas Department of Transportation official said Sunday, amid concerns about the structural integrity of the four story office building struck by the single engine plane.
Meanwhile, investigators continued to sift through the rubble Sunday, searching for clues as well as human remains.
Forensic evidence has not confirmed the identity of the pilot, thought to be Andrew Joseph Stack III, the author of an anti government rant published on the Internet.
On Saturday, officials identified the remains of Vernon Hunter, 68, the only person inside the building killed in the crash.
FBI agent Eric Vasys said federal investigators worked through the weekend searching for evidence that could shed light on the Thursday morning crash.
Vasys said investigators would be wrapping up their search soon. It will be up to the city, he said, to determine the safety and structural integrity of the Echelon I building, which houses Internal Revenue Service offices, Stack apparent target.
Even after investigators clear the site, TxDOT will not open the road until the building is determined to be structurally sound, said John Hurt, spokesman for the agency Austin district.
Officials at the St. Edward University Professional Education Center said classes and other activities at Echelon III, in the same complex as Echelon I, will resume today.
St. Edward holds classes for graduate students and employees of various companies in Echelon III
The crash site was cordoned off by police tape Sunday, and officers were posted around the perimeter. Across the highway, people gathered in the parking lot of the Gateway shopping center to take pictures of the building. Cars near the site slowed as drivers took a look at the wreckage.
As investigative work continues, questions linger about Stack, whom friends and neighbors described as a quiet man not prone to railing against the government in his everyday life.
Stack daughter from his first marriage, Samantha Dawn Bell, told an Associated Press reporter that the Web manifesto didn t sound like the father she knew.
&quot;It not him. The letter itself sounds like it coming from a different person,&quot; she said from her home in Norway.
Stack also lashed out at his Austin accountant, Bill Ross, in the anti IRS screed.
&quot;Mr. Stack contacted my firm to help with his personal taxes in 2008. He failed to provide me with all his income and other information resulting in an IRS audit,&quot; Ross said in a statement. Ross has not returned calls placed to his home and office.
&quot;Unfortunately, Mr. Stack ignored the audit and my advice which only complicated his situation, at which time our firm disengaged our services with Mr. Stack whom we have not been in contact with since October 2009,&quot; the statement said.
Chad Wilbanks, a spokesman for Ross, said Sunday that the accountant is doing well, despite having been named in Stack note.
&quot;On the whole, he just fine,&quot; Wilbanks said.

(NER-HARVEST "
Over the past few years, Pedernales Electric Cooperative has become associated less with its historical role of supplying power to the Texas Hill Country and more with lavish spending, secretive management and legal woes.
Bennie Fuelberg , who was its general manager for more than 30 years, was indicted last summer in the felony theft of money from the co op. Fuelberg and the co op former general counsel, Walter Demond , are accused of arranging for thousands of dollars of co op money to be paid to relatives of Pedernales executives between the mid 1990s and 2007.
The charges followed disclosures that stemmed from a member led lawsuit and detailed questionable dealings by Pedernales officials, lack of oversight by its board and closed door practices that kept the co op 200,000 plus members largely in the dark about its operations.
That was then. After beginning a series of reforms in 2008, the Pedernales board is poised today to enact new bylaws and proposed amendments to the organization articles of incorporation that will make the changes permanent.
The board hopes the policies will also make Pedernales already the largest member owned cooperative in the country a national model for open management.
&quot;We re hoping we have now established a new tradition and culture at PEC that this generation and future generations will embrace,&quot; board member Patrick Cox said.
Perhaps the clearest signal of that new culture is the proposed bill of rights for Pedernales members, outlining their rights to fair elections, access to co op meetings and open records.
Board President Larry Landaker said directors have been working to get the proposed policies ready for today board meeting in Johnson City so they can be placed on a referendum ballot. Members will vote on them at the annual June membership meeting.
Landaker said that no state laws require electric cooperatives to maintain open procedures, as Pedernales intends to do.
&quot;This is all voluntary,&quot; Landaker said. &quot;The key word is accountability.&quot;
Almost all of the &quot;old guard&quot; Pedernales directors have been replaced with a new group of reform minded members. Among the changes already initiated, they have:
Made board elections more open and accessible to members, allowed members to attend meetings and have access to agendas, and increased access to co op records.
Begun returning capital credits, the co op version of dividends, to members for the first time. In contrast to common practice in the industry, Pedernales had never returned credits.
Shut down a money losing subsidiary, Envision Utility Software Corp in New Mexico, and cut the pension of a former executive.
Reduced the size of the board from 17 to 11 directors.
Dismissed Demond law firm Clark, Thomas &amp; Winters as legal counsel after unexplained payments to relatives of Pedernales officials came to light.
Invested in renewable energy and made a commitment to reduce power usage.
Some are still skeptical of the co op new direction. &quot;I think some good changes have been made, but there more to go,&quot; said Ric Sternberg, a member of the watchdog group PEC4U and once a vocal critic. Sternberg said that new General Manager Juan Garza hasn t &quot;cleaned house&quot; as much as he should and that some bad eggs remain in management.
While he generally endorses the new bylaws, Sternberg said that board members should be limited to three terms instead of four and that they re still paid too much about $30,000 a year, on average.
But even Sternberg said he not as involved in watchdog work as he once was and is &quot;stepping back&quot; to see what the new board members can accomplish.
Garza says they ve accomplished a lot, and the new bylaws will solidify the changes.
&quot;I think the desire is to make what happened here never happen again,&quot; he said.
The cooperative began in the late 1930s with then US Rep. Lyndon Johnson attempts to bring electric power to the farmers and ranchers of the Hill Country.
During the late 1930s, the government contracts that paid Brown &amp; Root to construct the co op first electric lines were a boon to the impoverished Hill Country. The co op began to boom with Austin suburbs, generating tremendous revenue and gaining hundreds of thousands of members. Two thirds of Pedernales member customers are in the fast growing western parts of Travis, Williamson and Hays counties.
But unlike most electric cooperatives, the PEC never returned capital credits to its members. Fuelberg, the general manager since 1976, said the money was re invested in the co op infrastructure.
Beginning with a member led lawsuit in 2007, members and state officials began to demand that board members be more accountable about how they spent PEC money. Reports in the American Statesman, court proceedings and outside audits of the PEC soon documented Fuelberg authoritarian management style, a complacent board that rubber stamped his decisions and a lack of budget controls.
They also detailed a systemic pattern of questionable payments, transactions and business ventures that drained the co op of tens of millions of dollars, with its members having little or no knowledge of what was going on.
&quot;It appears the former general manager effectively isolated the board and everyone else in the cooperative from having any meaningful oversight,&quot; said a December 2008 report by Navigant Inc., an outside consultant. &quot;No one was minding the store except the general manager, and no one was minding the general manager.&quot;
