GoDiS Libraries README

This distribution contains the GoDiS dialogue move engine and the files
supporting it, i.e. the GoDiS libraries. It does not contain GoDiS 
dialogue system(s), but rather the files shared by GoDiS applications. 

To use the GoDiS libraries, Trindikit must be installed. Trindikit 
can be downloaded from  http://sourceforge.net/projects/trindikit. The 
latest, possibly unstable, version can also be accessed via anonymous 
cvs from the same site. Download and unzip, or check out to a nice 
location and follow the instructions in the Trindikit readme file for 
instructions on how to build Trindikit.

After installing Trindikit, the environent variable TRINDIKIT must be
set. Set Trindikit to the full search path of the Trindikit directory, 
e.g: '/home/david/trindikit-3.2.0'. For compability reasons, TRINDIKIT 
values like '/home/david/trindikit-3.2.0/dist' will be allowed for a 
while...

CONTENTS

general:
 Files shared by all GoDiS applications, e.g. concurrency settings, 
 prolog operators and definitions of data types

godis-basic:
 Information state definition, DME modules, control module and 
 resource interfaces for the godis-basic dialogue system (IBiS1) 
 (not very maintained). godis-basic is a very basic version of GoDiS for 
 information seeking dialogue

godis-grounding:
 Information state definition, DME modules, control module and 
 resource interfaces for the godis-grounding dialogue system (IBiS2) 
 (not very maintained). godis-grounding has the same DM capabilities as 
 godis-basic, but implements grounding as well

godis-iod:
 Information state definition, DME modules, control module and 
 resource interfaces for  godis-iod dialogue systems (quite maintained).
 godis-iod extends the DM capabilities of godis-grounding by 
 implementing task and question accommodation. This is probably the 
 library to use if you should implement a information-seeking-only 
 GoDiS application

godis-aod:
 information state definition, DME modules, control module and 
 resource interfaces for  godis-aod dialogue systems (most maintained).
 godis-aod extends the DM capabilities of godis-iod with
 action-oriented dialogue management capabilities. This is currently
 the most used GoDiS library.

godis-all:
 to be written

search_paths_all.pl, search_paths_basic.pl, search_paths_grounding.pl, 
search_paths_iod.pl, search_paths_aod.pl :  

 Assert prolog file search paths and library directories for the 
 different godis libraries. Consult the proper file for your library of 
 choice, e.g. like this for godis-aod:

  :- ensure_loaded('$GODIS/search_paths_aod.pl').

 This assumes that the environment variable GODIS has been set to the 
 GoDiS installation directory

search_paths_common.pl:
 loaded by the other search_paths-files

USAGE

Check out the godis-apps distribution (available via cvs) to see how 
GoDiS applications can be built using the GoDiS libraries. Also take
a look at (VAR ÄR MANUALEN?)
