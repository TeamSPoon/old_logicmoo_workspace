<h3>Adding new &nbsp;items<br>
   </h3>
     
<p>When adding items, choose one of the sections and write a <i>short description</i>
  plus a <i>item ID</i> enclosed in square brackets. Mark it with a <i>*</i>
 . The item id should consist of your initials and the date (in YYMMDD format) 
and a digit. The digit distinguishes between items submitted by the same person
on the same day. E.g. if your name is John Smith and it is October 3rd 2003,
the item ID will be <b>[JS 031003-1]</b> for your first submitted item of
the day and&nbsp;<b>[JS 031003-2]</b> for your second. This should all be
in bold face. <br>
 </p>
 
<p>If needed, provide a more detailed non-bold face description of  the item 
below the short description. This can be indented by enclosing it in a <code></code>
 blockquote tag. Also, put sub-items in the detailed description (see e.g. 
item <a href="#SL_030521-1"><b>[SL 030521-1]</b></a>).<br>
 </p>
 
<h3>Managing&nbsp; items</h3>
 
<p>When commenting    on items, specify your initials and the date enclosed 
by ordinary brackets ( see e.g. item <a href="#DH_030730-1"><b>[DH 030730-1]</b></a>
 ). Put the comment at the end. <br>
 <br>
 When an item is completely done and added to the CVS tree, mark it with
<b> X</b> and put it at the end of the respective list. Also mark it with<br>
   your intials and the date in curly brackets together with an optional
comment (see e.g. item <a href="#DH_030605-1"><b>[DH 030605-1]</b></a>) .<br>
   </p>
     When an item is abandoned, put it at the end of the respective list
and mark it with a<b> #</b>.

   <b>* Use icm:acc*neg:action(A) instead of request(up) - [DH 030905-1]</b><br>
     
<blockquote>   Can user dialogue move 'request(up) be seen as 'icm:acc*neg:action(A)' 
 where A is the current action? When system performs icm:acc*neg:action(A) 
 it has the meaning "I can not perform A" (at least in VCR domain). In this 
 case it would mean "I do not want A to be performed". Or does it not qualify 
 as ICM? Anyway, it would be nice to be able to reject issues and actions 
explicitly, by saing e.g. "do not add a program"/"stop adding a program" etc.

<blockquote>Interpretation module always translates input to the first no 
 of matching moves and system can not backtrack. This causes a big problem 
 when scaling up applications and implementing large lexica. Consider e.g. 
 TV programs where 'Nyheter' can be a title as well as a category. Two surface 
 forms may also (possibly) map to objects of the same sort but with different 
 semantic meaning. No idea of how to solve this</blockquote>
     
<blockquote>         
  <blockquote>This should be solved by enabling clarification  alternative-questions 
as feedback to polysemous input. This would be interrogative  feedback on 
the semantic understanding level&nbsp; (formally, icm:sem*int:Q}.  This will 
probably require that each polysemous input phrase corresponds to two (or 
more, depending on the number of meanings) non-polysemous output forms to 
be used when generating the clarification question.&nbsp;       <b>(SL 030731)

   </p>
     
<blockquote>- 1st strategy is the one used in many NL database search systems; 
 "one-shot" dialogues with some use of context for narrowing the search; presupposes
 that user takes intiative and adds further restrictions when needed; several
 results can be returned (so do this in connection with ND dialogue?)<br>

<blockquote>- "Do you want something to drink?" is a y/n question (?Ex.drink(X)) 
 but "presupposes" a wh-question "what do you want to drink"; both should 
be put on QUD to enable interpretation of the answer "A soda." to the y/n-question. 
 Answering "no" will also answer the wh-question ("nothing"). Need semantics 
 to handle this.<br>
   &nbsp; - "(You want to drink) A soda." as feedback adds a y/n question 
to  QUD, but also the wh-question "What do you want to drink"; this enables 
corrections  not preceded by "no", e.g. "juice!"<br>
