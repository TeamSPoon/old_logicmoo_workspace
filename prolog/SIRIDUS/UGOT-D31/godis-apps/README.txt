This folder contains GoDiS applications.

Note that most applications are in need of some revision in order to
run. Specifically, each application needs at least a start file and a
godis specification file. Earlier, these were located under
godis/dist/prolog/godis/godis-aod (or iod), and in fact they are still
there. For a clue as to how these files should look, see domain-vcr
(but note that even this application does not, at the moment, run in
asynchronous or gui mode due to a bug in the connection between godis
applications, godis, and trindikit).
