- exec_forget, exec_forget_except: forget everything that unifies with P 
  instead of only one Prop
- exec_protect: protect plan sequences as well

+ install tv card

- tvgodis
  - new directory 'domain-vcrtel' (?) containing login-domain and vcr-domain  

  - OAA java agents
    - nuance telephony functionality
    - vcr agent
      -Non-solver/agent classes imported 

      -ValidChannel (re)implemented
      -AddJob
      -GetChannels
      -CheckUser
      -RemoveJob
      -ExistRecJobWithId
      -GetRecJobs
      -GetWeekday (?) 
    
    - GetChannels should be renamed ValidChannels etc.
    - cronjobs etc now in godis/data. no good solution. 
      also - files should be created if they do not exist.
    - More intuitive representation of dates and times (i.e. date(Y,M,D) and
    time(H,M) ).

      
    - date agent (implement in prolog instead?) - done not tested
      
    - integrate prolog calendar see above instead of date agent

    -dev_query with arguments (like dev_do)
- trindikit in/output modules ( 

- control algorithm that works with both telephony and native audio



LATER:

- concurrent godis
 
- update demo

- put visualization java files in java directory...
