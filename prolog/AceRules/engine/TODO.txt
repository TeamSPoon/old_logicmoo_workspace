---++ Todo-List

---+++ Bugs

* Bugs of the grouping step:
  * Sort predicates inside of a group
  * No template can be a subset of another template (cf "Every user has something. John has nothing.").
* Allow the verb "overrides" only for priority statements
* "If there is someone X then X waits and X sleeps." should fail
* Simple rules are not equivalent to the internal rule format
* If group variables are outside the group but inside another group then the parsing succeeds, but it should not.


---+++ Modifications/Extensions

* CLP iterpreter should process auxiliary rules in a special way, in order to hide their existence
* Integrate well-founded semantics (smodels & lparse)
* Integrate defeasible logic interpreter (delores)
* Integrate Situated Courteous Logic Programs
* CLP: support for mutual exclusions
* Should we allow that-subordination?
* Verbalization of the group templates?


---+++ Clean-up and Documentation

* Update condensation.txt
* Documentation of the verbalizer modules
