You find yourself standing by the door of Captain Picard's quarters .
He isn't very fond of visitors, but you decide to stay and have a look around .
You can see several different ancient artifacts on tables and small pedestals, and a large wooden wardrobe is facing south .
A comfortable looking recliner with a matching footrest sits beside the door, along with a bright reading lamp and end table .
Two large windows offer a great view of space .
A small partition at the northern part of the room contains Picard's sleeping area .
