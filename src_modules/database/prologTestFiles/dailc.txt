A burned and broken propeller sat on the cement floor, marking the nose of the plane. Behind it, twisted metal was spread out in the shape of the small aircraft: a bent wing on the right, two amputated wheels on the left, the tail rudder in the shadows toward the back.

The investigators could not recreate the Cirrus.
&quot;There nothing left of the Cirrus,&quot; Rodi said. &quot;It was almost entirely consumed by fire. It just a pile of ash.&quot;
Investigators believe that the Cirrus took off from Erie Municipal Airport. Just north of Boulder, the plane collided with the Piper, which was ascending after taking off from the Boulder Municipal Airport. Rodi said that the planes likely collided at a 90 degree angle, with the Cirrus hitting the Piper where the wing attaches to the fuselage.
The final report on the accident which killed the pilots of both planes and a passenger in the Cirrus won t be available for at least six months, Rodi said.
In the meantime, investigators will continue to try and understand what caused the collision.
&quot;Where were they looking? What were they doing? Was the sun in their eyes?&quot; Rodi said. &quot;We re trying to look at ways of preventing this from happening again.&quot;

If Denver area voters approve a doubling of the existing 0.4 cent sales tax this year, the $6.7 billion project could be finished in 2017, FasTracks staff told the Regional Transportation District board FasTracks monitoring committee Tuesday night.
If voters OK a new tax in 2012, the buildout could be done by 2019.

(NER-HARVEST "Students should expect increased security at Boulder High School on Friday after school officials found a threat scrawled in a boys bathroom stall at the school.
Boulder police were called to the school on Tuesday after the message &quot;Everybody dies on 2 12 10&quot; was found in a third floor boys bathroom, Boulder police spokeswoman Sarah Huntley said.
Huntley said school resource officers worked with school officials to assess the threat. There isn t any indication the threat is serious or that any violence is imminent, Huntley said, but police will be working with the school to provide additional security on Friday.
Boulder Valley School District spokesman Briggs Gamblin said security officials have a protocol for determining whether a threat is serious. It includes the type of language used and the specificity of the threat, among other factors. Huntley said police also work with school officials to find out if anything else has been going on at school or between students that might escalate.
Huntley said the decision about how to respond to the threat belongs to school officials, and they decided not to cancel classes.
Boulder High Principal Kevin Braney said the &quot;absence of any other factors&quot; led to the decision to hold school on Friday.
&quot;We believe with these extra precautions, it is safe to have school,&quot; Gamblin said. &quot;We wouldn t have school otherwise.&quot; At this time, the school is not planning any specific security measures, such as asking students to leave their backpacks at home, Gamblin said. Instead, there will be extra security personnel at school, and teachers and other staff will be on heightened alert.
Huntley said such threats in the form of graffiti show up a few times a year in area schools.
&quot;It certainly grabs people attention, and, unfortunately in this day and age, it has to grab our attention,&quot; Huntley said.
Gamblin said incidents of threats seem to be decreasing. He thinks good peer pressure has played a role as students respond to security precautions like having to check their backpacks or deal with having to reschedule major tests.
&quot;As students are inconvenienced by it, it becomes seen as less clever and less cool,&quot; he said. &quot;It stopped being something that just annoyed adults.&quot;
Gamblin said it is rare for the student responsible for a threat to be caught, but the disciplinary consequences can be severe. The student also could face criminal penalties.
Braney said the school sent an e mail to parents and staff about the threat, but has not yet made an announcement to students. A staff meeting already was scheduled for Thursday afternoon, and Braney said administrators will take advantage of that opportunity to review security and emergency procedures.
Alison Bagli, a junior at Boulder High, said she didn t even know about the threat. She said administrators are right to not cancel classes, especially because threats occur so often.
&quot;Freshman year, it scary, but once you get past the first one, it not big deal,&quot; she said. &quot;It just a way that kids try to get out of school.&quot;
Brian Flores, also a junior, said he learned about the threats in one of his classes. He not worried about it, but he wishes the administration had let students know officially.
&quot;I think they re trying to keep us from worrying about it, but I d rather know,&quot; he said.
Flores said he not worried, but students shouldn t take the situation too lightly.
&quot;It perceived as a big joke, and kids don t take it seriously, which could be really bad if we had to do an emergency procedure,&quot; he said.

(NER-HARVEST "Requiring all existing multifamily homes to install automatic fire sprinkler systems would go a long way toward helping Boulder fire department meet national standards for efficiency, Fire Chief Larry Donner told the City Council on Tuesday night.
That one of the ideas tossed out Tuesday night when the City Council met with Donner for a study session about a draft Fire Master Plan, a document that outlines the goals and funding issues that will drive the department operations for years to come.
Donner told the council that the department isn t meeting national standards for arriving at the scene of emergency calls, and that the city growth, increased traffic and lack of funding for the fire department are all contributing factors.
While national standards call for the first fire engine to arrive within six minutes of a 911 call 90 percent of the time, Boulder respective mark falls short at seven minutes, 53 seconds.
&quot;When we re looking at response times, we re not making them,&quot; Donner said.
Traffic congestion, roadwork, traffic circles and the weather can all cause delays, he said. But the department is also falling behind on its goals for limiting the number of injuries to firefighters.
The department is also failing to meet its goals for public perception and job approval. A 2007 survey, the most recent data available, found that 82 percent of Boulder residents approve of the department performance. That below the goal of an 85 percent approval rating.
&quot;I really can t explain why,&quot; Donner said. &quot;We would like to do better.&quot;
In looking for solutions to lagging performance, City Councilman Matt Appelbaum asked whether requiring all existing multifamily homes not just new development to retrofit buildings with fire sprinkler systems would help with firefighter performance and reduced risk.
It absolutely would, Donner said.
&quot;That would make a large difference with property preservation and life safety issues,&quot; Donner said. &quot;It would go a long way to meeting the goals.&quot;
He said sprinklers would largely change the role of firefighters who respond to buildings equipped with them from putting out flames to reducing water damage. That means crews could take longer to arrive, with less risk to people.
But he warned that the costs of doing that might get passed onto tenants because estimated installation costs run up to $3.60 per square foot.
&quot;It not an insignificant cost,&quot; Donner said.
The council has talked about expanding sprinkler requirements since at least 2008, after a blaze at Fairways Apartments in east Boulder sent two women to the hospital with life threatening burns.
Boulder has required new multifamily buildings to include sprinklers since 1988. While city leaders at the time pondered whether they should force existing building owners to retrofit, they eventually decided against it because of protests over the costs.
Appelbaum said Tuesday that it a subject that still &quot;needs to be talked about.&quot;
Donner went on to say that the amount of money that the city funnels to the fire department would have to increase in the coming years if the city wants to keep services at their current level, or improve services.
On the list of projects in need of funding are upgrades to the department radio system, construction of a wildland fire facility, construction of a heated building for vehicle and equipment storage and moving Station Three, located at 1585 30th St., out of the flood zone in which it sits.
One idea being explored is whether the department can purchase smaller vehicles to send to medical emergencies, which make up more than 60 percent of all calls for service. This would help speed up response times, in part, as the smaller vehicles could more easily navigate some of Boulder narrow roads.
Donner said the department could do that, but it would take more than 20 years to pay off the initial investment. There are other drawbacks to that idea, he said, including limiting the types of calls that any given crew in a smaller truck could respond to without having to first return to a fire station.
One of the most pressing questions, however, is how the city plans to come up with the annual $65,000 needed to fund ongoing costs at Boulder new fire training facility, which opens in June. The council has not yet agreed to fund those costs.
The department plans to commission a study of how it might improve its performance and will revise the Fire Master Plan accordingly. The final draft should be completed by December or early next year.

(NER-HARVEST "Louisville is again looking at budget cuts, this time to make up for a major revenue hit from the recent closure of Sam Club.
At a Tuesday retreat, the Louisville City Council talked about the negative impact of Sam Club January closure and future revenues that will be generated from ConocoPhillips. The city is considering at least $250,000 in cuts and possibly $350,000 to $400,000 to keep its budget strong.
&quot;We have to take steps right now with the givens that we know,&quot; said Mayor Chuck Sisk. &quot;It going to be much easier to restore the cuts than to make more cuts.&quot;
Reductions up for discussion include closing the library either one day a week or for a full week during a slow time, furlough days for employees and eliminating special transit services. Cutting back on community events, like the Fourth of July celebration, also is on the table. Closing Memory Square Pool is also a possibility.
Several council members said they want to look into other ways to pay for community events, including charging residents a small annual fee. Some said they want to protect special transit, possibly by charging a user fee. Closing the pool also wasn t popular.
Louisville Finance Director Kevin Watson said Sam Club tax revenue contributed about $500,000 to the city general fund, along with $250,000 to the capital projects fund. He expecting to see a new retailer fill that 127,000 square foot spot at 550 S McCaslin Blvd. by 2011, but cautiously prepared his budget as if another major retailer would close.
&quot;Sam Club is a huge impact,&quot; Watson said.
At the same time, Louisville is looking forward to bright spots for its tax revenue.
The city recently received revenue projections from ConocoPhillips, which is building on a 450 acre site in Louisville. Those projections, which staff members said may be a little optimistic, show $930,000 in property tax revenue and $270,000 in sales tax revenue annually, starting in 2014 or 2015.
The ConocoPhillips campus will be constructed in three phases over the next 23 years. The first phase, planned for completion by 2013, will include 1.6 million square feet of offices, research space, a learning center and 120 hotel rooms.
The project also is expected to generate a one time boost to the city reserves through $7.4 million from building use taxes and $3.6 million in building permit fees.
Watson said that, even with the boost from ConocoPhillips, the city budget is still on a downward trend with expenses outpacing revenue in future years.
While budget cuts will keep the city in the black for now, council members generally agreed that the city eventually will need to ask voters for a property or use tax increase decreasing the city dependence on less stable sales tax revenue.
&quot;We will not be sustainable in the future, based on sales taxes,&quot; said council member Sheri Marsella.

(NER-HARVEST "Halfway through the first year of the Boulder Valley School District food service overhaul, the staff is working to increase participation and asking students, parents and community members what they think of the changes.
The number of students eating hot lunches has increased 4 percent over last year, according to Ann Cooper, a school nutrition expert who was hired this school year to be interim director of nutrition services.
But participation is not up as much as expected, Cooper said during Tuesday school board meeting, and overall nutrition services revenue is still down because of a significant drop in &quot;a la carte&quot; sales.
The district has made about $243,000 to date this school year from the sale of snacks and beverages compared to $710,100 made on a la carte items to this date last year, according to a mid year budget report.
The district had been hoping to offset an intended drop in a la carte sales with a larger increase in hot lunch sales. But that has not happened.
&quot;We feel like we re doing a lot of things that people asked us to do, and we re looking into why we re not up more,&quot; Cooper said.
School board member Helayne Jones praised Cooper for all her work and said that changes take time.
In response to student and parent surveys and in hopes of increasing hot lunch participation Cooper said her staff has retested 40 recipes and is changing the meals flavor.
&quot;We have 30 interns doing taste testing at every school,&quot; Cooper said, adding that she already made the decision to change the hamburger buns and other unpopular items that school cafeterias started serving at the beginning of the school year.
Cooper said she also holding an &quot;Iron Chef&quot; competition for high school students in April that will challenge them to come up with a recipe that could be served in schools and make 25 portions during a four hour competition.
The winning recipe will be added to next year school menu, Cooper said.
Boulder Valley launched an overhaul of its school food program last year by hiring Cooper consulting firm, Lunch Lessons LLC, to review the district food options.
Cooper issued a scathing report along with a long list of suggestions. The district is in the process of following those recommendations, and it hired Cooper to oversee the changes.
Among the many changes Cooper has made to the district food service schools now offer students a salad bar and hot lunches prepared with natural ingredients instead of processed foods. The children also now get pesticide free milk from Colorado dairy farms, whole grain breads, fresh Mexican food and all natural pizza.
The eventual goal is to move entirely to scratch cooking at the district schools, and Cooper said Tuesday that the district is still on track to do that in the next couple of years.
The district is paying for the changes and for Cooper work through community donations, and Cooper said Tuesday that she still working to raise more money.

(NER-HARVEST "To find out whether the Boulder community views gangs and gang activity as problems, the city may soon send out a survey to homeowners asking about their perceptions of gang issues.
Boulder Human Relations Commission, a group of five people appointed by the City Council to study issues of civil rights and to help alleviate social problems, is behind the push for a study about how well the community understands gang issues.
Jonathan Dings, a member of the commission and the chief of planning and assessment for the Boulder Valley School District, said that a survey could help the city better understand how to take on problems with gangs.
&quot;There is gang activity in Boulder, though it isn t the kind you read about in the newspaper for other cities that are much, much larger,&quot; Dings said. &quot;It worth knowing about how well folks think we are doing in this area, overall.&quot;
Dings said the survey is still in the preliminary stages, but could be sent out within the next four months. It might ask what people think gang members look like or whether gangs cause problems in their neighborhoods.
According to Boulder police, about 12 to 15 criminal cases each year are linked to gang activity. The cases range from relatively minor vehicle break ins to assaults and shootings.
Leisha Conners Bauer, who works with a Boulder County Healthy Youth Alliance and is also a member of the Human Relations Commission, said the city needs to know more about gangs and their impact on residents.
&quot;I think that there is a gang presence in Boulder, but that one of the things we need to look at what is the extent of that presence?&quot; she said. &quot;If you think about gang involvement, that impacts the health of our kids, which I think impacts the health of our community overall.&quot;
Ellen Miller Brown, chief academic officer for the Boulder Valley School District, is also a member of the Boulder Valley Gang Task Force. The group of 20 officials representing educators, law enforcement and youth advocates from across Boulder County meets quarterly to discuss ways to prevent, intervene and suppress gang activity.
&quot;I think we do have those issues of youth who feel disengaged in our community and find even gang life intriguing to them,&quot; Miller Brown said. &quot;We need to stop that. We need to find ways for youth to not feel that violent ways of interacting with their community are valuable or meaningful to them.&quot;
She said Boulder proposed survey about how the community views gang issues will help inform the group work.
&quot;It going to be really helpful to see if the community understands what a gang is,&quot; she said. &quot;It a community issue; it a community opportunity.&quot;
Miller Brown said it not known exactly how many people are involved in gangs in Boulder because police track them differently or not at all. One recent estimate put the number of gang members in Boulder at 300 to 400 including an estimated 50 at Boulder High School and another 20 to 50 at Boulder middle schools.
Sarah Huntley, a spokeswoman for Boulder police, said the best study the department has been able to do came in 2008, when city officers contacted at least 200 individuals with known gang affiliations.
In Lafayette, it estimated that gang activity has more than doubled in the last seven years. Police say gangs in that area include the 34th Street West Side Bloods a gang that originated in Boulder the Nortenos North Side Mafia, Surenos, Crips, the Insane Clown Posse and the East Side Latinos.
Sgt. Jason Pitts, of the Longmont Police Department Gang and Crime Suppression Unit, said there are an estimated 200 gang members in Longmont, made up of local, national and motorcycle gangs.
He said problems associated with gangs include mostly graffiti and fights among rival gangs, but the presence of gangs isn t as overt as it was a few years ago.
&quot;It probably not seen as much now,&quot; he said, thanks in part to officers working to arrest violent gang members and educate others about getting out of the gang lifestyle.
But gangs remain a persistent presence across Boulder County, he said.

&quot;I want to do it again because I think I have the format a little more dialed in. It also a great way to showcase what Ozo coffee has been doing,&quot; he said.
Ozo Coffee is now roasting its own coffee beans. Previously, Ozo was using beans from Allegro Coffee Company, a coffee shop in Thornton.
&quot;It a lot of fun,&quot; Lefcourt said of this week events. &quot;It brings people together. Everyone has a blast and you walk away from a barista competition more pumped on coffee than ever.&quot;
Other coffeehouses competing include Boulder Caffe Sole and The Cup and Louisville Dragonfly Coffee and Tea.
Baristas will serve 12 drinks to four sensory judges within the span of 15 minutes: four cappuccinos, four espressos and four signature beverages of the barista choice.
Two technical judges will be watching each competitor, and a head judge will oversee the process. Competitors are given two to three hours of practice and 15 minutes to set up before their turn.
Friday and Saturday are eliminating rounds and will feature 15 to 16 competitors each day from 12 to 5 p.m. The second and final round will feature the six advancing baristas and be held on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The winner will travel to Anaheim, Calif., for the United States Barista Competition, held April 15 18 at the Specialty Coffee Association of America Symposium.

(NER-HARVEST "Several south Boulder residents who live near Bear Creek Elementary are upset with plans to build a new gymnasium at the school instead of remodel the old one and they ve asked Boulder Valley School District Superintendent Chris King to intervene.
The project at Bear Creek which was approved by voters in 2006 as part of the district $296.8 million bond initiative proposed an enlarged and remodeled gym, among other building improvements, costing $6.47 million. Construction is scheduled to begin in June.
Bear Creek neighbor Sheila Carrigan said building a new gym behind the school on the west side, where kids play basketball on a blacktop, is not the same as expanding and remodeling the existing gym, which is on the south side. The proposed construction, she said, will block the view from her home and several of her neighbors homes, move the school closer to their property lines, and decrease their property values.
&quot;I ve put my house up for sale because of this, and people have said, No, we won t buy it because of this, &quot; Carrigan said.
She learned about plans to construct a new gym at a &quot;design advisory team&quot; meeting in October that neighbors were invited to on the premise that &quot;exciting things were happening&quot; at Bear Creek. Carrigan said she wasn t excited by the news and returned to subsequent meetings to make alternate recommendations on where and how the gym should be enlarged.
&quot;We really pleaded with them to follow the Educational Facilities Master Plan, and they voted not to,&quot; Carrigan said.
According to Boulder Valley bond and design officials, building a new gym behind Bear Creek will be less expensive, closer to outdoor play areas, maintain &quot;mature&quot; landscape on the school grounds and leave a &quot;soft surface play area&quot; untouched.
Carrigan said that if building a new gym was such a good idea, district officials &quot;should have thought of it when they did the huge master plan.&quot;
The decision to build a new gym goes back on what they promised voters in order to get millions of taxpayer dollars in 2006, Carrigan said.
&quot;I think it so important for government entities to stay in line with voters when they give them money,&quot; she said. &quot;I would expect that the district is going to have to come to Boulder voters and ask for more money again. I ve never voted against a school issue, but they have to do what they said they were going to do.&quot;
Carrigan appealed the design team decision to Boulder Valley planning director Don Orr. He upheld the design team decision to build a new gym because, for starters, the design team &quot;went beyond what is recommended in order to engage adjacent neighbors in the dialogue concerning plans for improvements at the school.&quot;
In a written response to Carrigan complaint, Orr said the plans to build a new gym fulfills the scope of the master plan that was approved by voters in 2006 and is the most cost effective choice that will cause the &quot;least disruption.&quot; Expanding the existing gym would be more expensive and displace physical education classes and other community programs for at least one semester, Orr said in the letter.
Orr explained that it is the design team job to &quot;clarify and refine the specific scope of work&quot; outlined in general terms in the facilities master plan, and the team decision to build a new gym &quot;fulfills the intent of the language of the master plan.&quot;
Marti Hopper, whose property line is about 25 feet from the school boundary, disagreed and said all of the other schools with plans to build new gyms said so before the 2006 vote. For example, she said, plans to renovate Southern Hills Middle School stated, &quot;a new main gym will be constructed.&quot; Plans for Mesa Elementary said, &quot;construct new gymnasium.&quot;
&quot;To me construct new gym is different than enlarge gym and remodel, &quot; Hopper said. &quot;This isn t consistent with the master plan.&quot;
After Orr rejected the appeal, neighbors asked to meet with Superintendent King. On Monday, the neighbors presented their concerns, and King has 10 days to issue a written response. On Wednesday, King told the Camera that he still reviewing the issue and expects to respond to the neighbors in a week or so.
If King finds that the gym plans align with district policy, the neighbors can request a hearing before the school board. Board president Ken Roberge said Wednesday that &quot;it inappropriate&quot; to comment about a potential hearing before it comes to the board.
If the board also sides with the design team, Carrigan said, she and her colleagues can take their complaint to court.
&quot;We so much do not want to go there,&quot; Carrigan said. &quot;I m just hoping they ll do the right thing by the community and the voters and keep the promises of the bond issue that I voted for.&quot;

(NER-HARVEST "The flaws and the erosion they`ve caused in public confidence have some scientists calling for drastic changes in how future United Nations climate reports are done. A push for reform being published in today`s issue of a prestigious scientific journal comes on top of a growing clamor for the resignation of the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
The work of the climate change panel, or IPCC, is often portrayed as one massive tome. But it really is four separate reports on different aspects of global warming, written months apart by distinct groups of scientists.
No errors have surfaced in the first and most well known of the reports, which said the physics of a warming atmosphere and rising seas is man made and incontrovertible. So far, four mistakes have been discovered in the second report, which attempts to translate what global warming might mean to daily lives around the world.
&quot;A lot of stuff in there was just not very good,&quot; said Kevin Trenberth, head of climate analysis at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder and a lead author of the first report. &quot;A chronic problem is that on the whole area of impacts, getting into the realm of social science, it is a softer science. The facts are not as good.&quot;
It`s been a dismal winter for climate scientists after the high point of winning the 2007 Nobel, along with former Vice President Al Gore, for championing efforts to curb global warming and documenting its effects.
In November, stolen private e mails from a British university climate center embarrassed a number of scientists for their efforts to stonewall climate skeptics. The researchers were found to have violated Britain`s Freedom of Information laws.
In December, the much anticipated climate summit of world leaders in Copenhagen failed to produce a meaningful mandatory agreement to curb greenhouse gases.
Climate legislation in the United States, considered key to any significant progress in slowing global warming, is stalled.
Some Republican US senators, climate skeptics and British newspapers have called for Rajendra Pachauri, chairman of the IPCC, to resign. They contend he has financial conflicts of interest involving his role with the climate panel and a green energy foundation he set up. He has vigorously denied any conflicts.
And in recent weeks, a batch of mistakes have been uncovered in the second of the four climate research reports produced in 2007.
That second report which examines current effects of global warming and forecasts future ones on people, plants, animals and society at times relied on government reports or even advocacy group reports instead of peer reviewed research. Scientists say that`s because there is less hard data on global warming`s effects.
Nine different experts told The Associated Press that the second report doesn`t rely on standards as high or literature as deep as the more quoted first report. And they cite communication problems between lead authors of different reports so it is harder to spot errors.
The end result is that the document on the effects of climate change promotes the worst of nightmares and engages in purposeful hyping, said longtime skeptic John Christy of the University of Alabama, Huntsville.
David King, Britain`s former chief scientific adviser who once lectured at the University of East Anglia, home to the climate center where scientist e mails were hacked said that scandal laid bare the weaknesses in the IPCC In a telephone interview, he said those who challenged the IPCC`s assessment &quot;are seen to be rocking the boat, and this, in my view, is extremely unfortunate.&quot;
Scientists argue that the bulk of the reports are sound.
&quot;The vast majority of conclusions in the IPCC are credible, have been through a very rigorous process and are absolutely state of the science, state of the art about what we know of the climate system,&quot; said National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief Jane Lubchenco.

(NER-HARVEST "Kindergartner Grace Reivich watched closely as a volunteer at her school demonstrated how to swing a rope in the air and lasso a bull.
&quot;You want to make a circle above your head,&quot; said Jack Klase, before he successfully lassoed the bull figurine that was set up in the gymnasium at Eisenhower Elementary School in Boulder.
Acknowledging the accomplishment, Grace excitedly clapped her hands together. And she did the same to cheer on each of her classmates before she took a turn of her own.
About 45 kindergartners at Eisenhower Elementary took the bull by its horns on Friday at a school rodeo. They also giddy upped on toy horses, racing around the gym.

(NER-HARVEST "Kindergartner Grace Reivich watched closely as a volunteer at her school demonstrated how to swing a rope in the air and lasso a bull.
&quot;You want to make a circle above your head,&quot; said Jack Klase, before he successfully lassoed the bull figurine that was set up in the gymnasium at Eisenhower Elementary School in Boulder.
Acknowledging the accomplishment, Grace excitedly clapped her hands together. And she did the same to cheer on each of her classmates before she took a turn of her own.
About 45 kindergartners at Eisenhower Elementary took the bull by its horns on Friday at a school rodeo. They also giddy upped on toy horses, racing around the gym. The morning started off with a visit from two live horses from the Colorado Horse Rescue.
The simulated rodeo coincided with the children`s study of ranchers and Colorado`s Wild West, said kindergarten teacher Sharon Baird.
Liza Milijasevic, whose daughter, Kate, is a kindergartner at Eisenhower, said the 5 year old is enjoying learning about Colorado`s history and participating in the rodeo.
&quot;She`s hoping to take riding lessons,&quot; Milijasevic said.
Logan Boye posed for a picture for his mother, wearing a cowboy hat, fringed chaps and a vest an outfit from his costume box at home.
He named his toy horse &quot;Crazy.&quot;

(NER-HARVEST "A bloody Kermit the Frog doll that closed Peak to Peak Charter School and brought out the Boulder County bomb squad last week was the result of a student prank gone wrong, according to Lafayette police.
The &quot;joke,&quot; which involved four male students ages 14 to 16, started a couple of months ago in a high school classroom, said Lafayette Police Cmdr. Mark Battersby. The teacher kept a stuffed Kermit the Frog doll in her room, and the teens &quot;kidnapped&quot; it as a prank, Battersby said.
They traded the Muppet back and forth for weeks, and Battersby said they colored it with fake blood using a red Sharpie pen.
&quot;They dressed up the frog to look like it had been assaulted,&quot; Battersby said. &quot;I think it looked like it had slashed wrists and cuts.&quot;
On the eve of the stuffed frog scare at the Lafayette charter campus which has about 1,200 students in kindergarten through 12th grades one of the teens who had the frog in his gym bag threw it in another student pick up truck, Battersby said. That student didn t want it, he said, so he told his brother to take it out and leave it in the parking lot so the first teen could come pick it up again.
That student never came back to get the bag, Battersby said, and it sat in the parking lot overnight.
&quot;That what caused the commotion,&quot; he said.
A school employee called police about 7:15 a.m. Wednesday after finding the bag and the wounded Muppet on the west side of the campus. Battersby said authorities and school officials were not only alarmed by the bloody faux amphibian but also because the bag contained aerosol cans later determined to be deodorant.
Police secured a perimeter around the school, and students and staff members who already had arrived at Peak to Peak were locked down in a building on the east side of the campus far away from the menacing Kermit doll.
The Boulder County bomb squad used a robot to safely examine the items in the duffel bag, and authorities cleared the school about 10 a.m. Peak to Peak remained closed for the rest of the day because so many students didn t make it to the campus before police blocked access.
&quot;It was never meant to cause the stir that it did,&quot; Battersby said. &quot;This was not part of the plan.&quot;
Lafayette police are not pursuing charges against the teenagers who were involved because they didn t mean any harm, Battersby said. The school, however, might discipline the students, he said.
Peak to Peak spokeswoman Carolyn Jannsen didn t comment about the incident or whether the students were disciplined.
&quot;The investigation is complete, and the matter is closed,&quot; she said.

(NER-HARVEST "What: Cherry Creek Arts Festival Mobile Art Gallery
When: Feb. 10 to March 2 (Public nights Feb. 24 25, 5 to 7 p.m.)
Where: Angevine Middle School, 1150 West South Boulder Road, Lafayette
More info: Call PTA co President Kerry Feiman at 303 335 4536
Lafayette Angevine Middle School will host the Cherry Creek Arts Festival Mobile Art Gallery, which features original artwork by exhibiting artists, from Feb. 10 to March 2.
The gallery will be located in the school library and primarily open to the Angevine community, but doors will open to the public on Feb. 24 and 25, from 4 to 7 p.m.
Several Angevine students will be chosen to help install, maintain and dismantle the gallery, and a Cherry Creek Arts Festival curator will train around 30 students to give tours of the artwork as docents.
Patricia Jones, the art teacher at Angevine, said the school was looking for a permanent art installation when officials decided the touring exhibit might be of greater benefit to the students.
&quot;Tying art to students lives is really important, and our kids especially our kids don t always have the opportunities to get to museums and galleries,&quot; she said. &quot;We re kind of far from Denver and Boulder, so the gallery is going to come to them.&quot;
Teachers will help educate students through the gallery accompanying program guides, which include biographies, resources and lesson plans that tie the art to different curricula at the school.
&quot;I m hoping kids go through at separate times, so if they go with a science teacher they ll see something different than if they go through with a math teacher,&quot; Jones said.
The nonprofit Cherry Creek Arts Festival organization manages the gallery as part of its outreach program, which strives to &quot;provide access to a broad array of arts experiences and support arts education in Colorado,&quot; according to the group Web site.
Hosting the gallery costs $1,100, but the Cherry Creek Arts Festival provided a grant to cover half the cost, according to Jones.
The gallery is one of two that the organization perpetually tours through Colorado, bringing its art to schools and other public spaces. The 20th anniversary of the organization flagship art festival is set to take place in Denver in early July, and features performance and culinary arts in addition to visual pieces.
Groups that wish to schedule a visit to the gallery are encouraged to contact PTA co president Kerry Feiman at 303 335 4536.

(NER-HARVEST "The Colorado Department of Human Services has suspended the childcare license of Nederland Over the Rainbow preschool after investigators following up on a teacher sex assault arrest found that three other employees have criminal backgrounds.
The school was closed Monday and will remain shuttered unless its leaders successfully appeal the suspension to a Colorado administrative judge, human services spokeswoman Liz McDonough said.
&quot;That the most serious action we can take immediately,&quot; McDonough said, adding that state and Boulder County social services departments are continuing to investigate. &quot;We ll follow up next week to make sure they re not operating.&quot;
Meanwhile, several parents are fighting for the school to reopen and have asked Over the Rainbow teachers to babysit their children during the day, said Catherine Camp, whose 5 year old son has attended the preschool for three years.
&quot;I believe in the school, and I believe in the teachers, and I think they are wonderful people,&quot; Camp said.
She said school officials, who could not be reached for comment Monday, held a meeting Sunday night to let parents and community members know what going on.
Kristen Barnett, 38, who started teaching at Over the Rainbow in the summer, was arrested Thursday after a student told her parents Barnett had touched her inappropriately several times, according to an arrest warrant.
Barnett did not have a criminal record before her arrest, but detectives learned that three of the school other four teachers do. According to court documents, Executive Director Marnie Copeland was arrested in 1997 on suspicion of public indecency; teacher Wendy Beatty was arrested in 2000 on suspicion of drunken driving and cruelty to a child and again in 2005 on suspicion of drunken driving; and teacher assistant David Driscoll was sentenced to prison in North Carolina for driving drunk.
Camp said she wants police to thoroughly investigate the allegations against Barnett, but she completely trusts the other teachers.
&quot;I ve never had one negative experience,&quot; she said. &quot;Not one. Nothing. Not a weird day. Nothing but joy.&quot;
At Sunday meeting, Camp said, about 17 people signed a petition to reopen the school, and Over the Rainbow attorney plans to take the document before a judge.
She said the closure has caused a major hardship for about 25 families.
&quot;It has positively put me out,&quot; Camp said Monday. &quot;My son stayed home with me today, and I didn t get much done.&quot;
McDonough said the state suspended the school license because &quot;there was enough concern with the background of people working there that we felt the children might be at risk.&quot; Although preschool closures can be tough on families, she said the state is &quot;going to err on the side of safety.&quot;
&quot;We know it disruptive to people to lose childcare,&quot; McDonough said. &quot;But this is a serious enough violation that we felt it was appropriate.&quot;

(NER-HARVEST "Students from Casey Middle School and Boulder High School submitted nine logos in a contest earlier this month, and youth are urged to vote on their three favorite submissions. A committee will then choose the winning logo from the finalists, and the winning student will get a chance to work with a graphic designer to have the concept logo professionally designed.
Voting will be open until Friday.
&quot;We`re still working on getting our image out there,&quot; said Kendall Frost, a CU student and marketing intern for the group. &quot;Things are just starting to get going. We`re moving from the planning phase to the action phase.&quot;
Growing Up Boulder was formed in 2009 as a partnership between the city of Boulder, the University of Colorado, the Boulder Valley School District and several other organizations as a way for city officials, educators and community members to address youth concerns, initiative coordinator Debbie Flanders Cushing said. The initiative also includes youth input, with action groups created to promote community art, conduct business surveys, and gather input on teen nightlife in Boulder.
&quot;What we`re really trying to do is get youth together who are interested in a certain topic, and help them either do research or figure out how to address a certain issue,&quot; Flanders Cushing said.
One of the action groups is in the process of conducting business surveys to determine which businesses are youth friendly and which are hiring youth, and another is creating surveys on teen nightlife in Boulder.
&quot;One of the major things [youth] say is that there is nothing to do at night, and that fact probably leads to other issues,&quot; Flanders Cushing said.
According to the initiative`s Web site, Growing Up Boulder is partially based on the goals and principles on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which only the United States and Somalia have not ratified, and it strives to give youth a voice.
&quot;We`re trying to reach out to all Boulder youth,&quot; said Frost. &quot;We want to hear their stories. We want to hear their ideas. ... We really want to start reaching out.&quot;
Youth who wish to get involved or voice their opinions about youth life in Boulder are encouraged to email growingupboulder@ gmail.com, or join the initiative`s Facebook group.

(NER-HARVEST "Halfway through the first year of the Boulder Valley School District food service overhaul, the staff is working to increase participation and asking students, parents and community members what they think of the changes.
The number of students eating hot lunches has increased 4 percent over last year, according to Ann Cooper, a school nutrition expert who was hired this school year to be interim director of nutrition services.
But participation is not up as much as expected, Cooper said during Tuesday school board meeting, and overall nutrition services revenue is still down because of a significant drop in &quot;a la carte&quot; sales.
The district has made about $243,000 to date this school year from the sale of snacks and beverages compared to $710,100 made on a la carte items to this date last year, according to a mid year budget report.
The district had been hoping to offset an intended drop in a la carte sales with a larger increase in hot lunch sales. But that has not happened.
&quot;We feel like we re doing a lot of things that people asked us to do, and we re looking into why we re not up more,&quot; Cooper said.
School board member Helayne Jones praised Cooper for all her work and said that changes take time.
In response to student and parent surveys and in hopes of increasing hot lunch participation Cooper said her staff has retested 40 recipes and is changing the meals flavor.
&quot;We have 30 interns doing taste testing at every school,&quot; Cooper said, adding that she already made the decision to change the hamburger buns and other unpopular items that school cafeterias started serving at the beginning of the school year.
Cooper said she also holding an &quot;Iron Chef&quot; competition for high school students in April that will challenge them to come up with a recipe that could be served in schools and make 25 portions during a four hour competition.
The winning recipe will be added to next year school menu, Cooper said.
Boulder Valley launched an overhaul of its school food program last year by hiring Cooper consulting firm, Lunch Lessons LLC, to review the district food options.
Cooper issued a scathing report along with a long list of suggestions. The district is in the process of following those recommendations, and it hired Cooper to oversee the changes.
Among the many changes Cooper has made to the district food service schools now offer students a salad bar and hot lunches prepared with natural ingredients instead of processed foods. The children also now get pesticide free milk from Colorado dairy farms, whole grain breads, fresh Mexican food and all natural pizza.
The eventual goal is to move entirely to scratch cooking at the district schools, and Cooper said Tuesday that the district is still on track to do that in the next couple of years.
The district is paying for the changes and for Cooper work through community donations, and Cooper said Tuesday that she still working to raise more money.

(NER-HARVEST "At most schools, climbing on lockers, jumping from balconies and scaling walls while balancing on railings will get land you in detention.
Not at Boulder Fairview High School.
A relatively new &quot;parkour club&quot; has gotten permission from Fairview Principal Don Stensrud to practice the physical discipline inside the school. And Stensrud is working with the Boulder Valley School District to prepare a legal document that would hold the students responsible for any property or bones they break.
&quot;It a great activity for these young men, and we are supportive,&quot; Stensrud said, noting that one club member had never done a pull up before getting involved in parkour. Now, all the participating students feel more physically fit, he said. &quot;So why not?&quot;
Parkour, or the art of moving, is a French originated physical discipline where the aim is overcoming any obstacle in one path by jumping, climbing, running and flipping over and around them. Participants run along routes and negotiate obstacles to find the most efficient path from one point to another.
Colorado Parkour is a Boulder based group that offers classes on parkour on the University of Colorado campus.
Fairview, Levi Satter jumps from locker to locker inside Fairview High School during a Fairview Parkour Club workout. The club has been working with school leaders and has their blessing to practice inside the school after class hours. ( CLIFF GRASSMICK )however, is the first Boulder Valley school to have a club of its kind and the first to give students permission to skip along balcony ledges and do backflips off the lockers. Stensrud said the legal liability forms that all the participating students will sign will serve a two fold purpose: keeping the students safe and covering the school in case something breaks.
&quot;These are top notch kids who take this seriously,&quot; Stensrud said. &quot;They want to assume liability if they were to damage something.&quot;
The students have found Fairview central commons area which has uniquely designed architecture with balconies, angled hallways, ramps and tall walls to be the most apt place to practice parkour, Stensrud said.
&quot;But they are real creative,&quot; he said.
The club got its start at the beginning of the last school year and has grown to between 10 to 15 members, said club president and Fairview senior Colin Bovet, 17. The group, which has only male participants so far, meets for two hours after school every Friday.
The students will practice daring moves like back flips and &quot;Kong&quot; jumps, where they plant their palms and tuck their feet to vault over a wall. They ll also run basic strength and conditioning drills, including push ups, running and stretching, Bovet said.
Parkour is in its natural state outdoors, but Bovet said students appreciate the permission to practice inside Fairview in the winter.
&quot;It a philosophy that turns the world into a playground,&quot; said Bovet, who has made a parkour video with his club members and posted it on YouTube.com (http://youtube.com/watch?v=ZrpQwTBDrEo).
Fairview freshman Ted Kornish, a new member to the club, said parkour also has practical purposes.
&quot;Hypothetically, if you are ever being chased by someone, which hopefully wouldn t happen, and you encounter an 8 foot wall, you would be able to run and scale up it,&quot; Kornish said.
Being trained to look at the world as a series of obstacles is helpful both physically and mentally, Kornish said.
&quot;If I looked at a 4 foot wall a few months ago, I would have said, I should walk around it, &quot; he said. &quot;Now, it just another thing to vault or dive over.&quot;
Kornish said he used to be afraid to try some of the more daring moves. But practice has given him confidence.
&quot;And one of the things we stress is that you don t do anything unless you are reasonably sure you can do it,&quot; he said.
Following is the Fairview club promotional video

(NER-HARVEST "Several south Boulder residents who live near Bear Creek Elementary are upset with plans to build a new gymnasium at the school instead of remodel the old one and they ve asked Boulder Valley School District Superintendent Chris King to intervene.
The project at Bear Creek which was approved by voters in 2006 as part of the district $296.8 million bond initiative proposed an enlarged and remodeled gym, among other building improvements, costing $6.47 million. Construction is scheduled to begin in June.
Bear Creek neighbor Sheila Carrigan said building a new gym behind the school on the west side, where kids play basketball on a blacktop, is not the same as expanding and remodeling the existing gym, which is on the south side. The proposed construction, she said, will block the view from her home and several of her neighbors homes, move the school closer to their property lines, and decrease their property values.
&quot;I ve put my house up for sale because of this, and people have said, No, we won t buy it because of this, &quot; Carrigan said.
She learned about plans to construct a new gym at a &quot;design advisory team&quot; meeting in October that neighbors were invited to on the premise that &quot;exciting things were happening&quot; at Bear Creek. Carrigan said she wasn t excited by the news and returned to subsequent meetings to make alternate recommendations on where and how the gym should be enlarged.
&quot;We really pleaded with them to follow the Educational Facilities Master Plan, and they voted not to,&quot; Carrigan said.
According to Boulder Valley bond and design officials, building a new gym behind Bear Creek will be less expensive, closer to outdoor play areas, maintain &quot;mature&quot; landscape on the school grounds and leave a &quot;soft surface play area&quot; untouched.
Carrigan said that if building a new gym was such a good idea, district officials &quot;should have thought of it when they did the huge master plan.&quot;
The decision to build a new gym goes back on what they promised voters in order to get millions of taxpayer dollars in 2006, Carrigan said.
&quot;I think it so important for government entities to stay in line with voters when they give them money,&quot; she said. &quot;I would expect that the district is going to have to come to Boulder voters and ask for more money again. I ve never voted against a school issue, but they have to do what they said they were going to do.&quot;
Carrigan appealed the design team decision to Boulder Valley planning director Don Orr. He upheld the design team decision to build a new gym because, for starters, the design team &quot;went beyond what is recommended in order to engage adjacent neighbors in the dialogue concerning plans for improvements at the school.&quot;
In a written response to Carrigan complaint, Orr said the plans to build a new gym fulfills the scope of the master plan that was approved by voters in 2006 and is the most cost effective choice that will cause the &quot;least disruption.&quot; Expanding the existing gym would be more expensive and displace physical education classes and other community programs for at least one semester, Orr said in the letter.
Orr explained that it is the design team job to &quot;clarify and refine the specific scope of work&quot; outlined in general terms in the facilities master plan, and the team decision to build a new gym &quot;fulfills the intent of the language of the master plan.&quot;
Marti Hopper, whose property line is about 25 feet from the school boundary, disagreed and said all of the other schools with plans to build new gyms said so before the 2006 vote. For example, she said, plans to renovate Southern Hills Middle School stated, &quot;a new main gym will be constructed.&quot; Plans for Mesa Elementary said, &quot;construct new gymnasium.&quot;
&quot;To me construct new gym is different than enlarge gym and remodel, &quot; Hopper said. &quot;This isn t consistent with the master plan.&quot;
After Orr rejected the appeal, neighbors asked to meet with Superintendent King. On Monday, the neighbors presented their concerns, and King has 10 days to issue a written response. On Wednesday, King told the Camera that he still reviewing the issue and expects to respond to the neighbors in a week or so.
If King finds that the gym plans align with district policy, the neighbors can request a hearing before the school board. Board president Ken Roberge said Wednesday that &quot;it inappropriate&quot; to comment about a potential hearing before it comes to the board.
If the board also sides with the design team, Carrigan said, she and her colleagues can take their complaint to court.
&quot;We so much do not want to go there,&quot; Carrigan said. &quot;I m just hoping they ll do the right thing by the community and the voters and keep the promises of the bond issue that I voted for.&quot;

(NER-HARVEST "ERIE Erie and Broomfield have settled a lawsuit over boundaries, buffers and future development, shortly before the contentious issue was set to go to trial.
The settlement allows Broomfield Vista Highlands, a planned 145 acre mixed used development northeast of Colo. 7 and Sheridan Parkway on Erie eastern fringe, to go forward.
Erie challenged the Vista Highlands development about a year and a half ago, saying it violated a 1998 agreement requiring an open space buffer between the municipalities. The settlement clarifies the buffer requirements and a boundary line location.
The new agreement, in effect until 2033, also settles several other disputed issues and reaffirms Broomfield promise to share revenue with Erie if a piece of agricultural property in Broomfield near the border is developed.
&quot;This agreement is clearing up 11 years worth of history,&quot; said Broomfield City and County Attorney Bill Tuthill. &quot;It brings us into the present.&quot;
He said the original agreement was designed to eliminate annexation disputes. But when Broomfield became its own county in 2001, that limited its ability to annex land.
The new agreement clarifies that Erie can annex the northwest corner of Sheridan and Colo. 7. Broomfield also agreed to grant Erie access points from Colo. 7 into Erie commercial properties.
&quot;The new agreement will allow us both to move forward in a clear, competitive way,&quot; said Erie Mayor Andrew Moore. &quot;We are in competition for the next round of businesses on Highway 7.&quot;
The new agreement gives Erie more flexibility in spending money dedicated to buying or improving open space in the buffer area, allowing the town to use the money for trail connections.
&quot;That big news for Erie,&quot; Moore said. &quot;We re working to get our trail system connected into Lafayette Coal Creek trail system.&quot;
Both Moore and Broomfield Mayor Pat Quinn said they were pleased that the disagreement was resolved before a trial.
&quot;It better to be friends and work together than to be in court,&quot; Quinn said.

(NER-HARVEST "ERIE The town Airport Advisory Board is no more.
The Erie Board of Trustees agreed Tuesday night to disband the board, which didn t have any remaining members. The trustees removed three members last week, three others resigned in protest and the seventh, David Hauger, also resigned.
The trustees voted unanimously to replace the advisory board with an airport &quot;working group&quot; that will include the Air Park Homeowners Association president, a representative of the west airport business association and a representative of the company that operates the airport. A town staff member and two trustees also would be in the group.
Trustee Tina Harris said the group can &quot;discuss what going on at the airport&quot; and communicate emergency airport closures and other news to the community.
But former advisory board members have said trustees made the wrong decision in dismissing members, saying Erie has lost decades of experience and airport expertise.
&quot;None of us are too concerned about being tossed off the board,&quot; said Bruce Morehead, one of the ousted members. &quot;What we re concerned about is what it means to the airport.&quot;
The trustees removed Morehead, Bev Cameron and Jack Horn, saying their involvement in legal action over the town decision to remove the Erie Municipal Airport second runway was a conflict of interest.
All three are Air Park residents and were among those named in an injunction request filed in Weld County District Court. The injunction was denied, and the Air Park Homeowners Association is considering whether to go forward with a lawsuit.
Cameron, who has lived near the airport for 30 years and served on the advisory board for two years, said she signed up for the advisory board because she wanted to make a difference.
&quot;If I have to agree with everything the trustees do, what the point of being involved?&quot; she asked. &quot;The town never listened to the airport advisory board anyway. We just got ignored.&quot;
Following the removal vote, advisory board members David McWilliams, Richard Rankin and Bill Whitman resigned in protest.
McWilliams, a pilot and retired school superintendent who moved to Erie a couple of years ago, said he didn t buy the town conflict of interest argument.
He said he been frustrated that the trustees didn t consult the advisory board before making major decisions that affected the airport.
He also said he didn t like that the vote to remove the three advisory board members was made when Mayor Pro Tem Glenn Massarotti the liaison to the airport board was absent.
&quot;I don t think it allowed for a fair discussion to take place,&quot; McWilliams said.

(NER-HARVEST "ERIE Voters may have the final say on a controversial proposal to connect Bonanza Drive to Vista Parkway.
Erie Board of Trustees is voting on ballot language for the April election at Tuesday meeting. Erie leaders say the extension could boost the town commercial development prospects and improve safety response times and overall connectivity within Erie.
But whether the voters or town leaders should decide on the extension is up for debate.
What: Erie Board of Trustees meeting
Where: Erie Town Hall, 645 Holbrook St.
About two years ago, the trustees indefinitely tabled the proposal to extend the road after more than 100 residents spoke against it.
Pat Miller, president of the Air Park Homeowners Association, said Bonanza goes through the middle of the quiet, rural neighborhood. Extending it could increase traffic and decrease home values. Plus, she said, the road was built over mine shafts, causing two sinkholes in the last year.
&quot;Adding more traffic would be dangerous,&quot; she said.
Residents also have called the proposal a betrayal of past promises. Miller and others said the developers of Vista Ridge promised the residents of Air Park never to extend Bonanza when the annexation of Vista Ridge went before Erie voters in 2000.
But town leaders said they weren t aware of any agreement that the town itself made with residents about the road connection.
&quot;There were a lot of developer promises that may have been made, but we have nothing in writing,&quot; said Trustee Cheryl Hauger.
She supports sending the question to voters.
&quot;It important to get a true feeling of what people want us to do,&quot; she said.
But Trustee Paul Ogg said that while he supports extending Bonanza, asking the voters to decide the issue doesn t seem right.
&quot;It pits the town against one neighborhood,&quot; he said. &quot;That doesn t build the kind of cohesive community I would like. The Board of Trustees should make the decision.&quot;
He said he supports connecting Bonanza to Vista Parkway mainly because it would improve emergency access. Now, there only one way in and out of the Air Park neighborhood. Connectivity is another reason to go forward, he said.
&quot;It just important in general to have the neighborhoods in our community connected to each other,&quot; he said.

&quot;I m not dumping this on Erie voters,&quot; he said.
Initial design work would allow the trustees to gather information on costs, safety issues and how it would affect residents, he said. Once a design study is completed, trustees would vote on whether to go forward with an extension.
Mayor Andrew Moore, who supported sending the question to voters, said the extension could boost the town commercial development prospects and improve safety response times and overall connectivity within the town.
But extending Bonanza generally is unpopular with Air Park residents. About two years ago, the trustees indefinitely tabled the idea after more than 100 residents spoke against it.
Residents say connecting Bonanza to Vista Parkway could increase traffic and decrease home values in their quiet neighborhood.
&quot;It just going to destroy that ruralness of Air Park,&quot; said Gail Hanson, who owns property on Bonanza.
Another concern is that the road was built over mine shafts, causing two sinkholes in the last year. Adding more cars is a safety concern, residents said. The road also is narrow and doesn t have sidewalks, bike lanes or breakdown lanes.
Larry Aniuk said he was told by town leaders that extending Bonanza would only be a &quot;minor inconvenience&quot; for residents like himself.
&quot;Putting thousands of cars on this undersized road that I happen to live on is significantly more than a minor inconvenience,&quot; he said.

(NER-HARVEST "There a decent chance that if you walked up to a US soldier fighting in Iraq or Afghanistan, some piece of equipment on his rifle would be stamped with the words, &quot;Boulder, CO&quot;
But Magpul Industries, a growing manufacturer of injection molded plastic parts primarily for use on the AR 15 weapons platform, isn t actually located in Boulder rather it a few hundred yards from the Boulder County border in Erie.
The company head honchos know this geographical fact, but they like the bit of irony that comes from a weapon gear manufacturer operating so close to the liberal stronghold of Boulder.
&quot;We put Boulder, Colorado, on everything that we make, and really that just a slap in the face to the hippies,&quot; said Drake Clark, senior director of sales and business development for Magpul.
Hippie slapping aside, Clark is dead serious about what Magpul does.
The company was founded in 1999 by former Force Reconnaissance Marine Richard Fitzpatrick. Fitzpatrick moved to Colorado after leaving the military, taking from his experience as a soldier the idea for a piece of gear that many soldiers improvised using duct tape.
Fitzpatrick dumped his savings into patenting a piece of molded rubber that attaches at the base of rifle magazines and allows shooters to pull them from storage pouches more easily thus, the Magpul was born.
&quot;The theory behind the products we come up with is basically that we find out what soldiers need to make their job easier,&quot; Clark said.
Skip ahead a decade, and the company has blossomed into a 100 employee operation that manufactures and assembles more than 60 plastic parts for various weapons, including state of the art rifle stocks, grips, magazines and gun sights.
Headquartered in a nondescript warehouse off East County Line Road and Austin Avenue, Magpul is headed by a group of veterans representing every branch of the American military, a heritage they take seriously when designing their products.
&quot;We build these products to put in the hands of the men and women who protect the freedom of our country,&quot; Clark said. &quot;The money that we make coming from the sale of our products (to civilian markets) goes back into making better products for the warfighter, period.&quot;
Clark said the company has seen explosive growth in the past five years, though he declined to offer specific revenue figures.
The scope of the company potential can be seen in its latest foray into firearm design. In a move away from making parts and pieces, Magpul recently completed the design of its Adaptive Combat Rifle the first fully functional assault rifle taken from concept to market by the company.
&quot;We started out making this little rubberized grip for your magazine, and now we re developing full weapon systems,&quot; Clark said.
The rifle design has been sold to Remington and Bushmaster Firearms International, which will each produce a version of the ACR; Remington for the military and Bushmaster for civilian and law enforcement markets.
In early 2010, the ACR will be entered into trials for a new military standard issue rifle to replace the longtime M4 and M16 rifle platforms. If the ACR is selected, it would have immense implications for the local startup.
&quot;Every rifle they sell is going to need these plastic parts,&quot; Clark said, and Magpul would be the exclusive provider.
Clark said he sees the company potential as nearly limitless, with possible expansions into other industries that require durable plastic parts.
&quot;In 10 years I would foresee Magpul venturing way past the firearms realm and getting into other industries that get our feet wet,&quot; he said.
But for now, the company is content with stickin it to the liberals.
&quot;We re fairly proud that we can be amidst a whole bunch of hippies and we can build gun parts that say Boulder on them,&quot; Clark said.

(NER-HARVEST "ERIE The developer of Vista Ridge Latitude community has filed for bankruptcy protection, saying the company needs to restructure to finish the 139 home development.
Vista Ridge Development LLC claimed in its Dec. 30 Chapter 11 filing that it owes its creditors at least $6.7 million.
So far, 39 two story homes in the Latitude development off of Colo. 7 and Mountain View Boulevard have been built and 33 of those have sold, according to court documents. Home prices are in the mid $200,000 to mid $300,000 range, while the homes are between 1,560 and 2,223 square feet.
The developer wants to build most of the remaining 100 houses as single story, ranch style homes because those are selling better in a tough real estate market, said Garry Appel, the company lawyer.
&quot;The ranch homes are a product they can sell,&quot; Appel said. &quot;That what they plan to focus on now.&quot;
The single story homes will be priced &quot;substantially lower&quot; than similar homes in the rest of the 900 acre Vista Ridge development, according to court documents.
Appel said Vista Ridge Development filed for bankruptcy after failing to reach a financing agreement with its lender, Colorado Bank and Trust. He said the developer secured a new construction loan from Charter Holdings, a company that affiliated with the developer.
Profits from the sale of new homes will pay the amount still owed to Colorado Bank and Trust about $4.1 million Appel said.
Other creditors include Vista Ridge Homeowner Association for unpaid dues, the Weld County Treasurer for property taxes and George Sanders Co. for plumbing supplies.

(NER-HARVEST "A 2009 research paper produced for Colorado Sex Offender Management Board: dcj.state.co.us
The Colorado Bureau of Investigation list of registered felony sex offenders: http://sor.state.co.us
For a complete list of registered sex offenders in your neighborhood, contact your police department.
A controversial sex offender management strategy is gaining some traction in eastern Boulder County communities.
So far, no local towns or cities have enacted sex offender residency restrictions, which can limit registered sex offenders from living near schools, libraries, playgrounds and other locations frequented by children.
Lafayette recently considered and rejected the idea.
But Erie and Louisville plan to discuss it in coming weeks.
Erie Mayor Andrew Moore said he wants to talk about it mainly because other communities also are looking at residency restrictions.
&quot;Once the first neighboring municipality puts in restrictions, they could all move here,&quot; he said. &quot;Our town is growing. We re adding a school. We re adding the new Community Park. It begs the question: Is there anything we need to do to make these places as safe as possible?&quot;
Erie town board is scheduled to consider the idea at a Feb. 2 study session. The Louisville City Council also directed its police chief to research the issue and is expected to discuss it in February or March.
Research, lawsuits reduce popularity
About 30 states restrict where sex offenders can live. Colorado doesn t have a statewide law, leaving it up to individual communities.
Creating sex offender free zones became popular in 2005 after the highly publicized murder of a 9 year old girl, Jessica Lunsford, in Florida by a sex offender who moved to her neighborhood.
Since then, legal challenges and research calling into question the effectiveness of those measures have led some places to reconsider. Research generally shows that forbidding offenders from living near schools doesn t reduce recidivism rates.
A couple of years ago, Lyons floated the idea of sex offender restrictions, but the town didn t go forward based on the recommendation of Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle.
Pelle said the law requiring sex offenders to register helps officers keep track of them. Impose residency restrictions, he said, and sex offenders are likely to go underground, move to remote areas or fail to register at all.
&quot;If they re going to be in our community, it safer for us to know where they are,&quot; he said.
Restrictions dubbed &quot;knee jerk&quot;
Another detractor is Michael Dell, who was convicted of sexual assault in Boulder in 1999 and is a board member of Colorado CURE, a national organization that advocates for prisoners and former inmates.
He said residency restrictions are based on the false assumption that registered sex offenders are highly likely to reoffend and to target strangers.
&quot;The majority of offenses take place in the home from families or close associates,&quot; he said. &quot;Only a small number of cases involve strangers, but that what the fear is based on. Residency restrictions are a knee jerk reaction and give a false sense of security.&quot;
In Louisville, the age of the offender, nature of the offense and effect on offenders living with immediate family would all need to be addressed, Police Chief Bruce Goodman said.
Broader questions include whether restrictions would hinder the reintegration of offenders into society, along with whether restrictions would prevent sex crimes.
Louisville has six registered felony sex offenders living within city limits, according to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. Goodman said there are typically about a dozen registered sex offenders living in the city, including those convicted of misdemeanor offenses.
As far as Louisville police could determine, no registered sex offenders have reoffended while living in the city, he said. Louisville sex offender registry also has never included a &quot;sexually violent predator.&quot;
Lafayette resident says better protection needed
Lafayette police department looked into residency restrictions in late 2009 but decided not to move forward because, Police Chief Paul Schultz said, &quot;I can t find an expert who thinks it a good idea.&quot;
He mapped out a 1,200 foot buffer around schools, parks and swimming pools in the 9.3 square mile city, which has about 45 registered sex offenders in all. The result, he said, was such a limited area where sex offenders could live that it would essentially banish them from the city.
Jack Varga, who lives behind Lafayette Circle Motel a collection of short term housing units that typically house two or three sex offenders said he doesn t know if residency restrictions are the right solution.
But, he said, local and state laws don t do enough to protect children.
As a parent, he regularly checks the sex offender registry so he can watch for those who live nearby. The list, however, doesn t include enough information for him to know who really a threat, lumping &quot;streakers&quot; in with violent offenders, he said.

(NER-HARVEST "She called the next day with a place for him to look at in Broomfield.
When he went to check it out, the 1950s home in Broomfield Heights didn t have much curb appeal, and he thought she must not want her commission too badly. Then he walked into the addition in back that looked like a private church minus the pews right down to the vaulted ceiling, stained glass windows and giant pipe organ. He took one look and decided this was the place to build San Luis Sound.
With a full beard, and with 9 month old son Story in a backpack, he looked a bit like a thinner version of Alan Garner from the film &quot;The Hangover&quot; as he led a tour of the studio. Anytime the baby acted up, he did a swiveling thing at the hips for a few seconds to rock him back to sleep.
Turse has been playing guitar and composing music for 26 years, and working as a sound engineer and producer for 25. His wife, Dana, is an engineer, and the home studio Turse main source of income for the past four years gives him the freedom to act as a stay at home dad. He schedules sessions so either Dana or their 14 year old daughter, Chloe, can babysit.
The barn/church was built to accommodate the hobby of the husband of Mary Jane Bailey, the first paid library director in 1961. Turse had the organ removed and installed a mixing board, added some furniture and put up some diffusers to break up the right angles that cause echoes.
&quot;Books are fantastic at absorbing,&quot; Turse said, so the library in back is about more than ambience.
He sounds like a scientist as he explains the physics behind every choice of what looks, on the surface, like a college bachelor pad. He won t ruin the ambience by soundproofing the walls, so the sound of barking dogs occasionally filters inside.
&quot;Whatever we lose in academic perfection we re gaining in comfort and vibe,&quot; Turse said.
Musicians have responded. His clients include Little Fyodor, Johnny Knows Karate, PsychoKnife, The Niwot Timberline Symphony Orchestra, Bodha and the Kohl Elementary Guitar Ensemble.
&quot;Most studios are sterile places,&quot; Turse said, which makes a studio session more like &quot;going to the dentist&quot; than making music.
He wants San Luis to be a place where a band can make albums, but with couches, funky decor and spectacular lighting from the windows when the sun sets. Many musicians have asked to use photos of their session for their albums.
When new musicians show up, Turse likes to stand back just to see where they naturally gravitate. They might wander, hitting a snare drum, judging the acoustics until they stop, and Turse runs over with a microphone. Others might keep looking at the portrait of the woman on the far wall, and he ll seat them so they have an image to meditate on as they play.
Because the space is so large, he doesn t have to record each track individually, but can record an entire band at once. He has recorded a 20 member Burmese group.
He done little advertising, relying on repeat business and word of mouth. He also has done soundtracks for independent films and cleaned up audio for documentary filmmakers who don t have the luxury of taping at acoustically pristine locales. He also designed the Square State Solid State equalizer almost entirely assembled locally with local parts that attempts to regain the tone shaping of the inductor based units that got lost in the digital age.
David Rynhart decided to record his solo indie folk album &quot;A Passing Comet&quot; at San Luis Sound after he discovered the studio during a recording session with a Celtic band.
&quot;Well, it more Joe,&quot; Rynhart said of why he chose San Luis. &quot;It makes a big difference who on the mixing board, but the space is wonderful the energy in there, it looks nice, you feel like being creative.&quot;

(NER-HARVEST "What: RTD is holding two public meetings to discuss proposed service changes that would take effect in May, which include cutting the Lynx bus service between Louisville and Broomfield
When: 7 p.m. Monday in Boulder and 7 p.m. on Feb. 4 in Louisville
Where: The Boulder meeting will be held at the West Boulder Senior Center, 909 Arapahoe Ave. The Louisville meeting will be held at the Louisville Recreation Center, 900 Via Appia Way.
After just two years on the road, the Lynx bus service may make its final trips between Louisville and Broomfield in May.
Lynx buses began to circulate between the two cities in the summer of 2008, connecting downtown Louisville to Park n Rides in Superior and Broomfield, Monarch K 8 and high school, the Avista Adventist Hospital and the FlatIron Crossing mall.
The project was launched with money from a two year Federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality grant, which covered 80 percent of the new service cost. Boulder County picked up the rest of the tab using transportation tax revenue, and the Regional Transportation District agreed to operate the buses.
County officials hoped that, if the Lynx proved to be successful, RTD would agree to take over the service when the federal money ran out. But RTD announced this week that it wouldn t take on the Lynx, which averages about five riders per service hour.
&quot;The Lynx didn t make the cut,&quot; said Scott McCarey, alternative transportation coordinator for the county. &quot;The ridership just isn t high enough. ... We have a couple of runs that, literally, no one gets on.&quot;
RTD did decide to take over the expenses of Boulder County Jump XL bus service which extends the Jump route into Erie in May. The route extension was also largely funded by the same two year federal grant that funded the Lynx.
&quot;RTD is really stepping up to the plate to take on the service,&quot; McCarey said. &quot;It a big deal.&quot;
The county is now deciding whether to keep a scaled down version of the Lynx alive or to spend its limited transportation dollars elsewhere. McCarey and his staff have been crunching the Lynx ridership numbers including when people get on and where to decide if cutting the runs that are &quot;real dogs&quot; can make the proposition financially viable.
Louisville Mayor Chuck Sisk hopes they can find some way to make it work.
&quot;We ve got a branding people know about the Lynx. If we can keep it alive and let people know that this is really something that they need to show how important it is to ridership, I hope it can work,&quot; Sisk said. &quot;If it goes away, the chances of it being resurrected are slim to none.&quot;
The county has appealed for financial help from the cities that are served by the Lynx, but the prognosis doesn t look good. Louisville leaders discussed the possibility of helping fund the Lynx, but they decided that amid looming budget cuts they couldn t take on any new expenses.
The county plans to make a decision about the Lynx future within the next two weeks.
&quot;It very well may die,&quot; McCarey said. &quot;We really have to be sensible about how we re spending our money.&quot;

(NER-HARVEST "A Boulder County grand jury has indicted a 26 year old Longmont man and his mother in connection with a 2007 single vehicle crash that killed one person and seriously injured five others.
Noah Ray Thomas and Mary Melissa McLarty, 47, were arrested Wednesday and remain in the Boulder County Jail. Thomas faces one count of vehicular homicide and five counts of vehicular assault. McLarty faces four counts of accessory to a crime.
According to the indictments, which were unsealed Wednesday, Thomas was driving seven passengers in a 1989 Chevrolet Blazer about 2 a.m. June 15, 2007, after a night of drinking at A Bit of Billiards Sports Bar &amp; Grill, 700 Ken Pratt Blvd. in Longmont.
Two female passengers had met Thomas for Mary Melissa McLarty (Boulder County Sheriff Office)the first time that night and accepted a ride home after one of his friends told them that Thomas was a designated driver, according to the indictment.
Thomas, who several witnesses said was drunk when he left the bar, is suspected of crashing the Blazer near the intersection of Monarch Road and US 287, careening into a ditch and hitting a tree.
The roof of the vehicle was crushed, the top covering the rear of the Blazer was sheared off and three male passengers were ejected, the indictment said. They were found 50 to 60 feet from where the vehicle came to rest.
Jeffrey Turner, 25, of Longmont, suffered massive head trauma and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the indictment. The other passengers suffered significant injuries including traumatic brain injuries, a ruptured spleen and lacerated liver.
Thomas who suffered a head injury and broken bones left the injured passengers at the scene and walked home with his brother, who also was in the vehicle and suffered minor injuries, according to the indictment.
When they arrived at their mother house at 6720 N 107th St., Thomas fell to the ground just inside the door. His mother, McLarty, saw her son injuries and called a friend with a tow truck instead of 911, according to the indictment. She then went to find the Blazer and discovered several people with &quot;serious bodily injuries.&quot;
One woman was standing on top of the Blazer hood screaming for help and saying, &quot;Oh, my God,&quot; according to the indictment. She saw another man semi conscious and mumbling in pain and another woman unconscious in the back seat of the Blazer, the indictment said.
McLarty left the scene after the tow truck arrived and didn t call police or ask anyone else to, according to the indictment. The friend, whom McLarty called for a tow truck, finally called 911 after arriving to the scene about an hour after the accident.
Paramedics started to arrive about 3:17 a.m.
Eventually, at 7:53 a.m., Thomas checked himself in to Longmont United Hospital. His blood alcohol level was 0.065 percent at the time, the indictment said.
&quot;Using the average rate of alcohol elimination from males, Noah Johnson would have had a blood alcohol level of .124 to .155 at 2 a.m. on June 15,&quot; the indictment said.
During the Colorado State Patrol investigation of the crash, Thomas made &quot;several contradictory statements&quot; about what had happened, according to the indictment. He told one trooper that he was sitting in the back middle seat, and he told medical personnel that he was wearing a seat belt in the front, the indictment said.
Thomas told a friend that one of the women was driving the vehicle. He later admitted to a friend that he should not have been driving that night, the indictment said.
McLarty hid the fact that two of her sons both Noah and Josh Thomas were in the vehicle, hindering the investigation, the indictment said.
&quot;They did not know Josh Thomas was an occupant of the vehicle until nearly a year later,&quot; according to the indictment.
Boulder County District Attorney Stan Garnett said he can t comment on the investigation because grand jury proceedings are secret.
&quot;But, at the conclusion of the State Patrol investigation before taking the case to the grand jury, we didn t believe there was sufficient evidence to charge a driver,&quot; Garnett said. &quot;There are a number of strategic advantages to the use of a grand jury which include the ability to compel testimony and investigate a complex fact pattern over a period of time.&quot;
According to state criminal records, Noah Thomas was arrested for drunken driving in September 2008 in an unrelated case. He pleaded guilty in that case and was sentenced to jail time and 18 months of probation.

(NER-HARVEST "What: Fun With Flowers Workshop, open to all skill levels
When: 9 a.m. the second Tuesday of each month
Where: Boulder County Extension Offices at the Boulder County Fairgrounds, 9595 Nelson Road, Longmont
Cost: $3 (includes some plant and line material); bring your own supplies and flowers
Information: Joan Castle at 303 684 9759
LONGMONT A group of Longmont women have gathered monthly for more than 20 years to discuss such topics as income tax, Independence Day and the inauguration. But don t let the political jargon throw you for a loop.
As odd as it may seem, these subjects are actually themes for flower arranging, and the women discussing them are members of Longmont Fun with Flowers Workshop.
On the second Tuesday of each month, participants in the Fun with Flowers Workshop meet at the Boulder County Fairgrounds in Longmont to learn the latest tricks in flower arrangements from local experts. Each topic is typically associated with the season or upcoming holiday. Last January, for example, participants learned to create festive, mass arrangements in celebration of the presidential inauguration. In April, they learned to create abstract designs representing, of all things, income taxes.
The 2010 schedule includes sessions on spring wreaths, sweet treats for Halloween and white arrangements for a white Christmas.
Participants say the sessions are engaging and always fun. The next session, scheduled for Feb. 9, will focus on &quot;Tools for Design: Containers &amp; Wood.&quot;
&quot;We are true to our name,&quot; said Kay Richards, co founder of the Fun with Flowers Workshop. &quot;We do have a blast and we enjoy each other, but we also like learning and doing the design work, too, of course.&quot;
Richards, along with two master flower judges, founded the workshop in 1988 to encourage people to learn about flower arranging for home arrangements, contests and shows. As they did back then, each session begins with a lecture by an expert and is followed by participants creating their own designs based on the lecturer topic. The sessions culminate with the lecturer critiquing each participant design. Regardless of skill level, the workshops can be informative and manageable.
&quot;We all have a beginning,&quot; Richards said. &quot;That is what this group is about: to help you in your beginning and to proceed from there.
&quot;We have people who have never done anything other than pick flowers, and then people who have been designing for a long, long time. It is really a continuing learning process.&quot;
Longmont resident Erin Angel, 40, was welcomed into the group two years ago.
At the group January meeting, she worked on a winter themed design with tall wooden sticks, large white flowers and a low black container. The arrangement represented snowflakes on the bare winter trees, she said. Longtime attendees like Richards raved over her sharp design and her exceptional improvement.
While Angel appreciates all she has learned, she said she loves coming simply to spend time with the friends she has made.
&quot;It pretty fun, but the ladies here are really what makes it,&quot; she said. &quot;I love the people and I think the mix we have is pretty unique. There are some people here who are considered experts and then there are people like me who come in and just throw some stuff together.&quot;
For veteran floral arranger Sandra Bolz the workshops give her the confidence to push her creative skills to new levels.
&quot;This class is always so constructive and so positive,&quot; she said. &quot;I think when you have that atmosphere, people feel safe to try something new. The arrangements get taller, bigger and more adventurous because no one is going to be critical. That safety helps us feel like we can try something crazy and it will be fine.
&quot;Everybody sees something different and we all learn every time. It just really fun.&quot;

(NER-HARVEST "The day after 19 year old Logan Sisson died of a stab wound on a stranger front porch in Longmont, Raymond &quot;Michael&quot; Palomino, 26, went to the Police Department and told investigators that his girlfriend had wielded the murder weapon.
A videotaped interview that Palomino gave to Longmont Detective Robert Dixon on April 21 was shown Friday during Palomino second degree murder trial. In the video, Palomino said he knew little about the fight in a Longmont park that led to Sisson death.
Palomino who police say let his girlfriend, Mariena Harris, 19, take the blame for the stabbing was arrested three days after the videotaped interview on suspicion of second degree murder. Witnesses told detectives that Palomino admitted to inflicting the fatal wound.
He accused of stabbing Sisson twice in the chest at Lanyon Park on April 20.
In his taped interview, however, he told police that he never went to the park and instead chose to stay with his son. He and his son got a ride straight from a party to Harris house, Palomino said. Once they were at the house, he said, Harris and Lakesha Crutcher, 20, told Palomino that Sisson had attacked them with a vodka bottle at the park.
When asked if Harris was armed, Palomino told officers that she had a pocket knife. During much of the interview, Palomino was mumbling and said he was embarrassed because he wasn t there to intervene.
&quot;I m pissed at myself,&quot; he said.
When pressed on details about how Harris had stabbed Sisson and what type of knife she had, Palomino avoided the question and instead said, &quot;She didn t think it was that bad.&quot;
&quot;She didn t know what else to do,&quot; he said.
Prosecutors have said that Palomino, Harris, Crutcher and a fourth defendant Robert Wittmer, 36 concocted a story to keep Palomino from getting into trouble. That eventually fell apart when witness reports and evidence conflicted with the accounts.
Both Harris and Crutcher pleaded guilty last week to accessory charges and were sentenced to probation and a year in the jail work release program in exchange for agreeing to testify against Palomino.
Crutcher is expected to take the stand in Palomino trial Monday.
Wittmer, who faces accessory charges, is scheduled to be tried Feb. 22.

(NER-HARVEST "The Longmont Police Department is proposing to implement a red light and speed enforcement system that could catch more reckless drivers and result in fewer accidents at busy intersections.
If the city approves a &quot;photo red light&quot; system, Longmont would join hundreds of US cities that rely on cameras and other technology to help enforce traffic laws.
The City Council recently authorized police to explore installing red light cameras at four busy intersections in the city: 17th Avenue and Main Street; Ken Pratt Boulevard and Main Street; Ken Pratt Boulevard and Hover Road; and Hover Road and Nelson Road.
Police also have proposed using a van that would record vehicle speeds in specific areas, such as neighborhoods and school zones.
To enforce traffic laws, police sometimes must chase violators and exceed speed limits, posing a danger to officers and citizens, said Sgt. Mike Bell of the Longmont Police Department during a recent City Council meeting.
&quot;In the case of red light enforcement, we often have to commit the same violation seconds after the violator has committed it,&quot; he said.
An automated system, Bell said, would eliminate such danger and be more efficient. The technology would operate &quot;24/7,&quot; assisting the six police officers and three community service officers in the police department traffic unit.
In the city of Boulder, cameras have significantly reduced red light violations and crashes at intersections where the systems have been implemented, Bell said.
However, the proposal already has drawn some opposition.
In public comments at a recent Longmont City Council meeting, one resident claimed that police cars, rather than technology, serve as a deterrent against traffic violations. Another critic said the idea is motivated by a desire to yield a profit.
But police say violators won t be slammed with heavy fines: Under Colorado law, tickets for red light violations through use of an automated system cannot exceed $75. And generally, speeding tickets issued through use of an automated vehicle system cannot exceed $40.
Longmont police are proposing to enter into a partnership with Redflex Traffic Systems, a company that operates in hundreds of US cities. On any given month, Redflex processes 700,000 violations through its partner programs, said Darren Kolack, a regional sales manager for the company.
The technology will not require taxpayer dollars, Bell said. Redflex will absorb the costs, implementing and managing the equipment. Redflex also handles other logistics, such as fielding calls from individuals who receive citations. Bell said police officers will review every violation that Redflex submits.
Whether the technology could yield a windfall for the city of Longmont remains to be seen. Revenues to the city would depend, in part, on Redflex costs to implement and manage the program.
Under Colorado law, the city would have to enter a contract with the company and pay a fixed fee per system, per month. However, Redflex says it would discount fees if the city were unable to collect enough money through the traffic citations to cover the costs.

(NER-HARVEST "A Boulder County jury has ruled that a health insurance company must pay $37 million to a Lafayette woman whose health insurance policy was canceled after she was seriously injured in a car accident.
The insurance company had said she failed to disclose previous medical treatments, namely an emergency room visit for shortness of breath and treatment for uterine prolapse. The company refused to cover roughly $185,000 in medical bills from the accident and canceled the woman policy.
The plaintiff attorney, Marc Levy of Greenwood Village based Levy, Morse &amp; Wheeler, had asked the jury to consider a verdict of $7 million or $8 million based on the evidence. He said he was &quot;shocked, but obviously very gratified&quot; when the six person jury returned on Friday with one of the largest jury verdicts in Colorado history.
&quot;The jury was asked to consider how we want insurance companies to treat people,&quot; Levy said. &quot;It sends a message that the answer is Not like this. &quot;
Levy said the large verdict is very satisfying for his client Jennifer Latham, a former preschool teacher who now supports her four children on Social Security disability payments but nothing will change for her in the short term. He said Time Insurance Co., which also does business as Assurant Health, will almost certainly appeal the decision.
&quot;The first thing (Latham) said to me was, Hopefully this will change how they do business, &quot; Levy said. &quot;She finally got her day in court after four years, and six citizens of Boulder County said, We do not think this is right. &quot;
Peter Duckler, a spokesman for Assurant Health, said he could not comment on litigation or say whether the company will appeal.
Latham, now 39, suffered multiple compound fractures and a brain injury when a suspect fleeing police rammed into her car in October 2005 near the intersection of 23rd Avenue and Collyer Street in Longmont.
Latham spent a month at Longmont United Hospital and another month at the Mapleton Center for Rehabilitation, Levy said.
Five months before, she bought an individual health insurance policy from Time Insurance Co. for herself and her two younger children. Her older children were covered under her ex husband insurance through work.
Soon after she was released from the hospital, she received a letter from Time Insurance informing her the company had rescinded her policy and would not pay her expenses from the accident. The decision to cancel her policy also made it nearly impossible for her to get insurance from other companies, Levy said. She now receives Medicare benefits.
Last year, Congress investigated Assurant Health and several other insurance companies for their rescission practices.
Assurant CEO Don Hamm testified that investigations into full disclosure of past medical treatment are not based on the cost of a claim but are only initiated when someone makes a claim related to a chronic condition that is likely to have existed before the person requested insurance coverage.
He also testified that policies are canceled only when the missing information would have affected the decision to insure that person.
Hamm and the other insurance executives all said they would not change their policies to only cancel coverage in cases of deliberate fraud, as opposed to simple error or misunderstanding.
An investigation by the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations showed that health insurers WellPoint Inc., UnitedHealth Group and Assurant Inc. canceled the coverage of more than 20,000 people, allowing the companies to avoid paying more than $300 million in medical claims over a five year period.

(NER-HARVEST "Once every three years since 2001, family members and friends of Mary Ann Bryan make the three hour drive from Longmont to Canon City for a visit to the prison there. On Monday, they re making that drive again.
&quot;I fear the day we don t show our faces to fight, they are going to think we don t care and that is not the case,&quot; said Bryan daughter, Jenifer Deeter, who was just 9 when her mother was dragged out of a Longmont pharmacy at gunpoint on Jan. 28, 1981, and murdered.
The 27 year old Bryan body was found in a blood splattered outhouse three miles outside Niwot three days later. Police later determined that Herbert Marant, who was 28 at the time, had paid convicted felon Robert &quot;Tattoo Bob&quot; Landry $10,000 to murder his ex wife, who had just won a seven year custody battle for their daughter.
Landry confessed to first degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 1989. Marant was convicted of first degree murder and conspiracy to commit first degree murder and also was sentenced to life in prison.
Marant first started coming up for parole in 2001, when the Colorado State Board of Parole had to decide whether to release him or set a new parole hearing one, two or three years later. Each time Marant has come up for parole in 2001, 2004 and 2007 the board has rejected him for release and set his next hearing three years out.
Monday marks Marant fourth parole hearing, and Bryan family and friends along with a representative from the Boulder County District Attorney Office will be there to oppose his release.
&quot;He can deny the parole hearing he doesn t have to go up for parole,&quot; Deeter said. &quot;But he accepts it, and he speaks on his behalf and brings people on his behalf to speak.&quot;
Deeter said Marant is being held in minimum security &quot;because he an upstanding prisoner.&quot;
&quot;He a schmoozer, he knows how to make people believe,&quot; she said. &quot;He found God, and God has forgiven him. But forgiveness can only go so far, and it can t replace all he taken away.&quot;
Headlines about jail overcrowding and state budget cuts have Deeter and her family worried that one day there won t be room for Marant.
&quot;It feels like a matter of time before they start letting prisoners go who they feel aren t a threat,&quot; Deeter said. &quot;But I fear him being released, and I fear for the safety of my family.&quot;
Deeter and her husband have three children, and she said, &quot;I don t want to be looking over my shoulder.&quot;
&quot;He planned this out calculatingly and hired someone to come and take my mom and take her life and take her from my life, and he didn t think twice about anyone but himself,&quot; she said. &quot;A man like that, who can have that sort of thought in his head, doesn t belong in the community.&quot;
Deeter said she, her grandmother and numerous other people speak at the hearings against Marant release. Deeter said she tells the board the horror of what happened and how it changed the family forever.
&quot;At 9, no one understands that mom not coming home any more,&quot; she said. &quot;But my mom never came back. There are no more Christmases for her. No more birthdays. No more hugging and loving or anything like that. Why should he be able to have those experiences and walk freely after the choices he made?&quot;
The Boulder County District Attorney Office is sending chief trial deputy Bruce Langer to oppose Marant parole in person. And District Attorney Stan Garnett has sent a letter to the board imploring them to reject parole.
&quot;The Mary Ann Bryan murder is one of the most heinous crimes ever committed in Boulder County,&quot; Garnett wrote. &quot;Herbert Marant rightly received a life sentence. Although he is eligible for parole under the statutory scheme in place when Ms. Bryan was brutally murdered, I strongly oppose parole at this time. Parole for Herbert Marant is absolutely inappropriate given this terrible crime.&quot;
Every time Marant comes up for another parole hearing, the family has to relive the horror and grief of losing Bryan, said her mother, Darlene Allen.
&quot;But we ll go back every year if we have to,&quot; she said. &quot;We re afraid of him. He a danger to all of us. Who would he hire? Who knows? But he evil.&quot;

Work could start by Feb. 15, and the building could be occupied by Christmas, Fire Chief Joe Bruce told council members.
The headquarters is the last facility to be built with money from a $26 million bond issue voters approved in 2006, which also paid for the district`s training center, a maintenance facility and a fire station on Via Varra Road.
Bringing North Metro`s headquarters to Broomfield has been in the works for a while. The building is a key part of the Civic Center master plan, which was approved in 2008 after years of study.
Construction was scheduled to begin last year. The City Council approved the design April 14, and a ceremonial groundbreaking was held in June. But the lot remained vacant except for a sign identifying it as North Metro`s future home.
Construction was delayed while North Metro downsized the building to cut the construction budget. The floor space was cut by 15 percent, the building will use cheaper materials and a water feature outside the building`s entrance was nixed from the plans.
That cut the construction price tag from more than $6 million to about $3.6 million, Bruce said after the meeting. The facility`s total cost will be about $4.3 million when equipment and furniture is added, he said.
Almost every feature of the building was reconsidered with an eye to cutting costs.
&quot;We had a litany of things. When you`re cutting design costs, you`re looking at everything,&quot; Bruce said.
Council approved the plan despite disappointment the water feature was removed. Water from the feature would have rolled down a series of platforms, symbolically radiating out into the community, Bruce said.
Councilwoman Linda Reynolds praised the fountain as a public artwork, and Councilman Bob Gaiser and Councilwoman Lori Cox said they were disappointed by its removal.
Bruce said architects and district staff could go back over the plans to see if it could be added. After the meeting, he estimated the price of a water feature to be between $40,000 and $100,000.

(NER-HARVEST "ERIE Business owners at Erie Municipal Airport are nervous about their future.
With the town poised to make key airport decisions in the coming months, owners say they re concerned that the changes will make it tougher to stay in business.
So they ve formed a business association, comment regularly at town meetings and participate in an airport working group all with the hope that the town will work with them to leverage the airport revenue generating potential.
&quot;Its frustrating out here,&quot; said Kim Davalos, president of Aero Systems Inc. and one of 14 owners in Erie West Airport Business Association. &quot;We just want to run our businesses, but I don t always feel comfortable with the direction of the town. We re all a little spooked on what our future is out here.&quot;
Located on Colo. 7 about three miles west of Interstate 25, the airport was founded in 1978 and purchased by the town out of bankruptcy from a private owner in 1992 and is operated by a private company.
The town last year commissioned an outside economic development study on the airport and has been making changes, often controversial, based mainly on the study recommendations.
Those changes include removing a second runway from the airport plans and raising fees for direct airport access for adjacent residents and businesses. The town also is looking for an outside company to handle day to day operations, along with the overall management issues that now are overseen by the town.
Erie Mayor Andrew Moore said the town isn t trying to make things difficult for business owners, but simply wants to make the best decisions for the airport viability.
&quot;We want to ensure the airport future,&quot; he said. &quot;Realizing the potential of the airport requires change, and sometimes change is uncomfortable.&quot;
Gordon Page, who part of the West Airport Business Association and owns the Spirit of Flight Museum, said the airport provides jobs and sales tax revenue.
&quot;There needs to be a better job educating the town that this airport is a great amenity,&quot; he said.
About 230 planes, mainly single engine, are based at the airport, as are a variety of businesses including three flight schools, a maintenance shop, a propeller overhaul shop and the museum.
Page said he was &quot;stunned&quot; happily so when the town board last week approved a plan for a new crossing that addressed the group concerns. The crossing provides the only access to planes from the runway to west side businesses.
The town initially recommended that the business owners chip in about $30,000 to help pay for the new crossing, which Erie officials say is needed to add an underpass for a future trail that planned to go through the airport.
But last week, the town board unanimously approved a plan that requires the town to cover the full cost and maintain the new crossing.
The next issue is a &quot;Through the Fence&quot; licensing agreement, which allows businesses to move airplanes back and forth between the airport runway and their shops. The town board is scheduled to vote on the agreement at its Feb. 9 meeting.
Dave Hampel, who owns Rocky Mountain Propellers, said he baffled by the town insistence that businesses need to add pricey fencing to improve security as part of the agreement.
&quot;For the 15 years I ve been here, security hasn t been an issue,&quot; he said. &quot;The system hasn t been broken.&quot;
Town officials have said the Federal Aviation Administration is requiring the changes, but business owners say the town is relying on FAA guidelines not mandates that have yet to be approved.
&quot;The true test will be the finalization of that agreement,&quot; said Davalos of Aero Systems. &quot;The unknown is very stressful.&quot;
She and other business owners said they chose the Erie Airport because they like the friendly, small town atmosphere. But they want to see the town to take more time in making decisions and pay attention to their concerns.
&quot;We really do try to work with the town,&quot; said Davalos, who been at the airport for 30 years. &quot;We ve got very good people out here. We need the town to listen to us.&quot;

(NER-HARVEST "The analysis by the Trust for Public Land is the first to put a dollar value on the benefits of the state`s conservation easements, said Tim Wohlgenant, the group`s Colorado director. The report comes amid Colorado`s looming $1 billion budget shortfall, and the possibility of cuts to a state program that offers tax credits to set aside lands.
A total of $511 million was spent on conservation easements in Colorado from 1995 through 2008. The money came from Great Outdoors Colorado, which uses state lottery revenue, and state tax credits.
The process of quantifying the value of the 1.4 million acres under conservation easements in Colorado was based on the economic benefits of open space, wildlife habitat, clean water, scenic views and other qualities.
Jessica Sargent Michaud, an economist with the national Trust for Public Land, said she used geographic data to group Colorado`s conservation easements into 16 distinct ecosystems. She then assigned the land a per acre dollar value based on figures used in about 10 published studies and consultations with state agriculture extension agents.
Examples include the premiums people pay to live next to open space, costs of cleaning up polluted water or money spent on recreation and tourism.
John Swartout, executive director of the Colorado Coalition of Land Trusts, said leaders in the Glenwood Springs area have determined that protecting open space along the Colorado River for trails leading into the city has been an economic boon for tourism.
The land trust`s report is a welcome first attempt to estimate the worth of conserving Colorado`s natural heritage, something that doesn`t fit neatly in the marketplace, said Andrew Seidl, associate professor at Colorado State University`s Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics.
&quot;This study makes explicit what all Coloradans know implicitly what is good for Colorado`s native landscapes is good for Colorado,&quot; Seidl said.
In Colorado, state tax credits for conservation easements jumped from $2.3 million in 2001 to $98 million in 2008, prompted in part by a change in 2003 that allowed the credits to be transferred and sold.
In 2008, reforms targeted fraud fueled by appraisers who overvalued the land. Federal and state authorities are challenging tens of millions of tax credits granted for conservation easements.
Land trust organizations brought the problems to the state`s attention and changes were made, including reviews of property appraisals, Swartout said.
Now, Gov. Bill Ritter has proposed cutting back the current $52 million tax credit program to save money. A proposal would reduce the tax credits by $13 million in January 2011 and another $13 million in the second half of the fiscal year.

(NER-HARVEST "Two state lawmakers are working on measures to draw tighter boundaries around enterprise zones.
&quot;The problem with enterprise zones is that they are permanent,&quot; said Democratic Rep. Mark Ferrandino, of Denver. &quot;We need to look at reviewing them periodically and changing or getting rid of them when needed.&quot;
One of the head scratching enterprise zones is Denver`s LoDo neighborhood. The area was once a rundown warehouse district but now boasts a major league baseball park and the city`s priciest high rise condos.
Under current law, companies get tax breaks on investments for new equipment, job training, research and development, and rehabilitating vacant buildings to be used for new businesses.
House Republican Leader Mark May, another sponsor of the enterprise zone idea, said businesses should be pre certified by the state before getting the tax breaks.
Christina Reddin, director of Grand Junction`s Business Incubator Center, said she didn`t oppose revisions to the law. But she reminded lawmakers that enterprise zones are the only tools some areas of the state have to rebuild their economies.

(NER-HARVEST "A 12 person jury went home Tuesday night without deciding the fate of a Longmont man accused of fatally stabbing Logan Sisson, 19, in a park on April 20, and jurors will return Wednesday to continue deliberating.
The jury started deliberating Raymond &quot;Michael&quot; Palomino second degree murder case Tuesday. He could face up to 31 years in prison.
Jurors could convict Palomino of the lesser crime of criminally negligent homicide if they decide the killing was accidental. Palomino could spend up to three years in prison if convicted on that charge.
&quot;But the evidence doesn t support that,&quot; Ryan Brackley, first assistant to the district attorney, said in his closing arguments Tuesday.
Prosecutors say Palomino went Raymond Palomino to Longmont Lanyon Park with Robert Wittmer, 36, after Palomino girlfriend, Mariena Harris, 19, told him over the phone that she and Lakesha Crutcher, 20, had gotten into a fight with Sisson. Palomino is accused of then stabbing Sisson in the heart and leaving him for dead while he went to Harris house and smoked methamphetamine.
Palomino defense attorney argued during his trial, which started last week, that Palomino didn t knowingly kill Sisson. But when Palomino left the park, he admitted in the car to stabbing Sisson and later told another friend, &quot;I shanked him,&quot; Brackley said.
&quot;He didn t say, I think I stabbed him accidentally. I meant to punch him, &quot; Brackley said.
&quot;How do you get a knife 4 inches straight into the chest?&quot; he said. &quot;You ve gotta use a whole lot of force.&quot;
Palomino defense attorney Mark Johnson told jurors that his client brought a knife to the park because his girlfriend had told him over the phone that Sisson had assaulted her and Crutcher. As Palomino pulled up to the park with Wittmer, he saw something that gave him reason to believe his girlfriend was in imminent danger, and he acted in her defense, Johnson said.
&quot;He sees two women who have been beaten,&quot; Johnson said, adding that Sisson was holding a vodka bottle that he had used as a weapon.
Both Harris and Crutcher pleaded guilty in January to accessory charges and were sentenced to probation and a year in the jail work release program in exchange for agreeing to testify in the trials of Palomino and Wittmer.
Wittmer, who faces accessory charges, is scheduled for trial Feb. 22.

(NER-HARVEST "The cook off, which raises money for Flatirons Habitat for Humanity, returns Saturday to Broomfield United Methodist Church.
Pastors from four Broomfield and Boulder churches will face off to see whose dish draws the best reviews from the crowd, which votes for their favorite by placing donations in tip jars.
The chef with the most tips gets bragging rights for next year.
&quot;It could be they have the best tasting food, or they have the most enthusiastic support,&quot; said Dianne Buchholz, a member of the Broomfield United Methodist Church who is organizing the event.
The tips and money raised through ticket sales go to Flatirons Habitat for Humanity for projects in Broomfield and Boulder counties, said Derek Wittman, a Habitat for Humanity official who is helping organize the event. Prior cook offs raised $5,000 to $6,000.
Habitat for Humanity is a nonprofit organization that builds affordable homes for low income families. Homeowners make mortgage payments and also pay in &quot;sweat equity&quot; during construction.
Attendance is expected to be between 300 and 400 people, but the pastors have been told to bring enough food for 500, Wittman said.
The reigning champion is Broomfield United Methodist Senior Pastor Ken Brown, who won last year with his pulled pork sandwiches.
Brown will sit out this year, Buchholz said. The home team will be represented by Youth Pastor Pete Smith, whose &quot;Vote for Me or I ll Cry&quot; meatballs took second place last year, and Pastor Thomas Cross, Buchholz said.
They will be joined by United Church of Broomfield Pastor Greg Garland, Ted Howard from St. John Episcopal Church in Boulder, and Jason Hays from First Congregational Church of Boulder.
Also appearing but not competing will be three future Habitat homeowners who will serve samples of their favorite dishes, Wittman said.
The event will raise a nice amount for Habitat for Humanity, but that not the only purpose.
&quot;It helps to build bridges and strengthen our support in the faith community,&quot; Wittman said.
Local churches provide volunteers and sponsor area projects, Wittman said.
Their support is needed because Habitat leaders have big plans for Broomfield, Flatirons Habitat executive director John Lovell said.
Flatirons Habitat for Humanity has worked on 15 homes in Broomfield, but its last major project was building duplexes on Emerald Lane. Those homes were occupied in 2007. Habitat ongoing projects are in Boulder and Lafayette.
This summer Habitat for Humanity and Broomfield will partner to acquire, rehabilitate and sell a foreclosed home in Broomfield. The project, which was unveiled at the Jan. 26 City Council meeting, will draw money from a $438,357 federal grant and rehabilitate up to three homes.
Flatirons Habitat also is looking for land in Broomfield for another large project on the scale of Emerald Lane.
&quot;We re excited because this is our reentry into Broomfield,&quot; Lovell said.

(NER-HARVEST "Bark beetles have been able to infest about 3 million acres of pine trees in Colorado without long bouts of subzero weather to kill them, said Joe Duda of the Colorado State Forest Service.
Shorter winters and warm weather that brings rain rather than snow spell big trouble for Colorado`s ski areas, said Auden Schendler of the Aspen Skiing Co.
Aspen Skiing has taken steps to become more energy efficient and help cut fossil fuel emissions, which produce greenhouse gases and heat the atmosphere, Schendler said.
&quot;What matters most is getting people in Washington to know that we care about this,&quot; Schendler said.
The ski company`s chief executive has talked to White House officials and members of Congress. David Dittloff, a regional coordinator with the National Wildlife Federation, said the environmental group has flown hunters and
anglers to Washington and worked with American Indian tribes and businesses to promote legislation to reduce greenhouse gases.
The economic benefits of Colorado`s wildlife total about $3 billion annually, including hunting, fishing and wildlife watching, Dittloff said.
The environmental group released a report Monday on climate change titled &quot;Odd ball Winter Weather: Global Warming`s Wake up Call for the Northern United States.&quot;
Schendler said erratic weather shorter winters, rain in the spring instead of snow has been a wake up call for the ski industry. Colorado`s ski areas don`t start making money until March, said Schendler.
&quot;If you lose March in the ski industry,&quot; Schendler said, &quot;you go out of business.&quot;
The warmer weather also makes it tougher to make snow, he said.
A big part of the solution is to replace coal fired power plants with cleaner burning fuels, Schendler said. He criticized Rep. John Salazar, D Colo., for joining a congressional caucus on coal.
Salazar represents western Colorado, which includes Aspen and other ski resorts.

(NER-HARVEST "Logan Sisson mother bowed her head and wept Wednesday when a jury after deliberating 11 hours convicted Raymond &quot;Michael&quot; Palomino of second degree murder for stabbing the teenager in the heart in a Longmont park on April 20.
&quot;It an overwhelming relief,&quot; Susan Sisson said. &quot;Now my husband and I can start the grieving process, which we ve been denied.&quot;
Palomino, 26, could spend up to 48 years in prison on the murder charge. He scheduled to be sentenced April 30.
The jury eight women and four men also convicted Palomino of child abuse for bringing his young son into a dangerous situation that night and of possession of a controlled substance.
When Boulder County District Court Judge Maria Berkenkotter read the verdicts Wednesday, Palomino showed little emotion. His mother and sister had left for the day, and only his cousin was in the courtroom for support.
Susan Sisson said that sitting through the trial was difficult for her family because it replayed the horror of losing Logan. She said the jury members were thorough and she appreciates their service, but waiting for the verdict was difficult.
&quot;We were sitting on pins and needles,&quot; she said.
Palomino was among four people arrested in connection with Sisson death.
Palomino girlfriend, Mariena Harris, 19, and Lakesha Crutcher, 20, fought with Sisson, 19, in Longmont Lanyon Park before the stabbing. Palomino went to the park with Robert Wittmer, 36, to intervene and stabbed Sisson twice.
Palomino let Harris take the blame for the stabbing, and she, Crutcher and Wittmer were arrested hours after the stabbing. Palomino was arrested days later because witness reports conflicted with the story that he and his co defendants originally told police.
Crutcher testified against Palomino during the trial, and Sisson sister Lennie Sisson said the woman honest testimony was healing.
&quot;I forgave her after she testified,&quot; (Logan Sisson)Sisson said. &quot;She did what most decent people would do.&quot;
Defense attorney Mark Johnson indicated after the verdict that he intends to appeal his client conviction.
Ryan Brackley, first assistant to the district attorney, said he appreciates that the jury was thoughtful and thorough.
&quot;A murder conviction is never something to celebrate,&quot; he said. &quot;Our thoughts are with the Sisson family.&quot;
Jurors leaving the deliberation room Wednesday declined to talk about how they came to their conclusion. One juror said only that it was &quot;a very challenging process&quot; and &quot;very emotional.&quot;
Both Harris and Crutcher pleaded guilty in January to accessory charges and were sentenced to probation and a year in the Boulder County Jail work release program.
Wittmer, who faces accessory charges, is scheduled for trial Feb. 22.

(NER-HARVEST "BROOMFIELD Odeum Colorado is no more.
Managers of the 6,000 seat venue in Broomfield announced Thursday that the arena has been renamed 1stBank Center.
Broomfield officials say they are happy with the new name.
&quot;It great to have a sponsor, especially one that a prominent Colorado company,&quot; Mayor Pat Quinn said.
The name change was announced two months after AEG Live and Kroenke Sports Enterprises executives unveiled the Odeum name at a crowded news conference in Denver.
AEG Live and Kroenke Sports co own Peak Entertainment LLC, which manages the 3 year old arena. The arena is owned by the city and county of Broomfield, and until December it was known as the Broomfield Event Center.
The new naming rights deal will last for five years, so another quick name change is unlikely.
How much 1stBank is paying for the naming rights was not disclosed. The bank company will be able to use the facility for corporate and philanthropic events and give customers preferred ticket access, according to a news release issued Thursday.
The arena will boast a large marquee with the new name, and a 10 by 10 foot orange cube with the 1stBank logo will be added to the center roof.
The management contract that Peak Entertainment and Broomfield signed in August gave the company the right to sell the arena name. Finding a sponsor was a goal from the start, AEG Live Rocky Mountain president Chuck Morris said.
The Odeum moniker, derived from the Greek term for a concert hall, was temporary. Morris said as much in December, when he said Peak would continue to look for a corporate sponsor.
&quot;It a tough world out there,&quot; Morris said this week. &quot;If you can get a corporation that can bring in financial help and also be a promotional partner that has various tools to reach a tremendous audience, that is immeasurable.&quot;
Founded in Lakewood in 1963, 1stBank has more than 120 locations in Colorado. Its headquarters remain in Lakewood, and executives highlighted the local connection.
&quot;The 200,000 drivers that travel on (US) 36 each day, and the tens of thousands of people who will attend events at the 1stBank Center annually, will have no doubt about which hometown bank supports the events they enjoy,&quot; John Ikard, president of the bank holding company, said in the news release.
The sale of the naming rights will benefit Broomfield financially, Deputy City and County Manager Charles Ozaki said. The amount will go into the arena revenue pool. Broomfield is entitled to 25 percent of the arena revenue for three years, and 10 percent of revenue for the remaining 27 years of the management agreement with Peak Entertainment.
The money also will offset some of the $500,000 Broomfield is spending to help Peak renovate the arena to make it more concert friendly.
The bulk of that work, which will cost more than $1.13 million, will be done by March 5, when the Odeum hosts its first concert. Furthur, a collaboration of Phil Lesh and Bob Weir, two of the founding members of the Grateful Dead, will perform March 5 and 6.
The amount the arena makes from corporate sponsorships will be reported to the city and become public information, but terms of the deals between Peak and individual sponsors such as 1stBank will remain confidential, Ozaki said.
The Denver Post contributed to this report.

(NER-HARVEST "What: Peace Corps information meeting
When: Thursday, Feb. 11, 6 to 7 p.m.
Where: University of Colorado, Hellems 141
colorado.edu/iece/peacecorps/events.html
The Peace Corps announced Thursday that the University of Colorado is ranked second in the nation for large universities with the most volunteers for the second straight year.
With 95 undergraduate alumni currently serving in the Peace Corps, CU maintains its No. 2 ranking from last year after moving up a spot from its 2008 ranking of third.
The University of Washington, ranked first for the past four years, beat out CU by just six volunteers this year. The University of California at Berkeley, Michigan State University and the University of Florida are also ranked in the top five.
Volunteers like CU alumnus Kevin Wheeler use their knowledge in education, health, business, environment or community development to support grass roots projects around the globe.
Wheeler joined the Peace Corps in 2002 after CU classes moved him to action and spent two years in the Dominican Republic building water systems.
&quot;Nothing can substitute the time you spend on the ground,&quot; Wheeler said. &quot;Being immersed in a culture really allows you to understand the details of how and why people live the way they do.&quot;
Since the Peace Corps inception in 1961, 2,252 CU alumni have volunteered. Historically, University of California, Berkeley maintains the No. 1 ranking with a total of 3,412 Peace Corps volunteer alumni.
The Peace Corps is approaching its 50th anniversary with nearly 200,000 volunteers serving in 139 host countries. There are currently more than 7,500 volunteers serving in 76 host countries. For more information on the Peace Corps, visit peacecorps.gov.

(NER-HARVEST "What: CU Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics is hosting an open house to watch the launch of NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory, which is carrying a CU instrument.
When: Doors open at 7:45 a.m. Tuesday morning, when scientists will kick the event off with a short talk. The launch is scheduled for 8:30 a.m.
Where: LASP, 1234 Innovation Dr. in Boulder
When NASA new Solar Dynamics Observatory rockets into space on Tuesday, a $32 million instrument developed and built by the University of Colorado will be on board.
CU Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment, or EVE, will measure the intense radiation that blasts Earth during solar storms, causing unstable space weather that can affect satellites, GPS systems, power grids and even ground communication cables.
The observatory will take a snapshot of the sun every 10 seconds with the three instruments on board including EVE and then send the data down to Earth via a satellite dish in New Mexico.
&quot;We will have real item data coming down to the ground every minute,&quot; said Tom Woods, a scientist at CU Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics and EVE principal investigator. &quot;The data rate is about 150 megabits a second. That more than a half million songs a day.&quot;
The massive amounts of real time data, which will be publicly available, will help scientists at CU and across the world refine their understanding of how space storms impact systems on Earth.
Woods said he and other researchers are particularly excited about how the wealth of new data will help them understand solar flares, violent eruptions in the sun atmosphere that can equal a billion atomic bombs. Current observing technologies only allow scientists to capture about 3 percent of a solar flare The Extreme Ultraviolet Variablity Experiment, or EVE, was designed and built by the University of Colorado. One of three instruments aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, it will measure the radiation that blasts Earth during solar storms. Photo courtesy NASA life, Woods said, but the new observatory will allow them see 100 percent of the phenomenon.
Woods expects EVE to be fully operational within 60 days of its Tuesday launch.
Interim Provost Stein Sture said that CU involvement with the Solar Dynamics Observatory is just the latest successful partnership with NASA
&quot;This continues to cement the longstanding relationship with NASA, which has resulted in CU Boulder becoming the single largest public university recipient of NASA research dollars,&quot; he said. &quot;This contract is part of a larger framework of excellence and relationships that make CU a major player in global aerospace research.&quot;

(NER-HARVEST "DENVER (AP) Colorado farms sold $70.2 million in organic products in 2008.
The USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service released results this week from its first survey on organic production. It showed Colorado had 220 organic farms in 2008, with 34 percent in organic production for less than 10 years.
That includes farms that are certified organic and those exempt from certification because they have less than $5,000 in annual sales.
Of the 14,540 organic farms and ranches counted nationwide, nearly 20 percent were in California, whose $1.15 billion in sales represented 36 percent of all US organic sales.
Food is considered organic if it produced without pesticides, petroleum or sewage sludge based fertilizers, herbicides, genetic engineering, antibiotics, growth hormones or irradiation. Animals must be fed organic feed and have access to the outdoors.

The Leeds of School of Business is offering a new tax help program this year for low income families and individuals at the University of Colorado campus. The Tax Help Colorado provides free tax preparation for families who make under $49,000 year.
The program is a product of an expanding partnership between the Denver based Piton Foundation and Colorado colleges focusing on helping people eligible for the earned income tax credit and child tax credit. CU and Adams State College in Alamosa are the first four year universities to participate in the program.
&quot;It about time our flagship university got this going,&quot; said Susan Morely, a senior business law instructor at the Leeds School of Business.
The service operates out of the Koelbel Building, Room 360. Sessions are on Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Wednesday evenings, 5:30 to 8 p.m. Free parking is available. A list of required documents and forms prepares are qualified to file is listed on the Leeds School of Business Web site. The program ends March 13.
The program allows qualified students to gain experience filing tax returns, as well as save low income families the cost of professional tax preparation. All preparers are required to pass an Internal Revenue Service certification exam. Participating students receive two hours of independent study credit for their time.
&quot;It is great providing this service for the citizens of Boulder because we are the only ones in the area providing a great service like this,&quot; said Sara Wicther, a senior accounting student.
Wicther, who participated in the program first session last weekend, said she was pleased with the results.
&quot;I had one couple with three children and I ended up saving them $10,000,&quot; said Wichter.
Piton Foundation representative Diane DiGiacomo, who has helped coordinate the Tax Help Colorado program at CU, is optimistic about the program in Boulder.
&quot;With all first year sites, it takes awhile for people to realize it there,&quot; she said. &quot;It been a nice partnership. We ve worked with Bob Hullinghorst, Boulder County treasurer, and the Boulder County Social Service office to mail out notification to all public benefit recipients in Boulder.&quot;
Those who have received help from the program have expressed their satisfaction and gratitude. Magdalena and Gregory Olesiak are Polish immigrants who had their tax return filed on Wednesday evening at the Koelbel Building.
&quot;Great people and great service for us they are lifesavers,&quot; said Magdalena Olesiak.
The Koelbel Building site offers translators who speak Spanish, Vietnamese and several other languages. For more information and other Tax Help Colorado locations, visit leeds.colorado.edu or piton.org.

(NER-HARVEST "Ritter said Colorado is the first state with a voter approved Renewable Energy Standard of 10 percent that passed in 2004. Lawmakers doubled that to 20 percent by 2020, and it would increase another 10 percent under legislation that had its first hearing Thursday.
Qualified renewable energy projects include wind, solar, geothermal, biomass and other projects approved by the Public Utilities Commission.
&quot;By requiring utility companies to generate nearly one third of their electricity from renewable sources, we will continue to improve our energy, environmental and economic security,&quot; Ritter said.
Republicans immediately pounced on labor provisions requiring state regulators to consider employment and economic factors when evaluating new electric generation resources, including wages, health benefits and worker pensions, calling it &quot;a hodgepodge for special interest groups,&quot; including unions.
&quot;We see this as an attempt to drive the labor force into union hands,&quot; said Rep. Frank McNulty, a Republican from Highlands Ranch.
Mike Cerbo, executive director of the Colorado AFL CIO, said there is no requirement that contractors use union labor, but he said the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which has 4,000 members in Colorado, offers the best training to qualify for the new jobs.
Mary Broderick, spokeswoman for the IBEW, said union members earn about $30 an hour, compared with nonunion workers who get paid as little as $7 an hour, but the union`s focus is on worker safety.
&quot;This is not about the unions,&quot; she said following a news conference with Ritter at the state Capitol.
Ritter, a Democrat, told the House Transportation and Energy Committee during a hearing on the bill that the plan is not a payback for union support after McNulty referred to it as the &quot;big labor payback provision.&quot;
Ritter said people who want to work on the projects can get training at community colleges and vocational schools.
&quot;Labor may benefit from it, but the value we get is consumer and public safety,&quot; he said.

See if books are checked out or available
Find branch hours and directions
Book lovers on the go now have an easier way to find out if titles are available at Boulder and Broomfield area libraries, which have launched a redesigned Web site especially for mobile phones.
Card catalogs are the way of the past, according to Matthew Hamilton, the manager for Boulder library innovation and technology.
&quot;We have been seeing increased use of our Web site on mobile devices,&quot; Hamilton said.
To meet the growing demand, the Flatirons Library Consortium made up of the Boulder Library system, the Louisville Public Library and the Broomfield Public Library turned to its online vendor.
Innovative Interfaces, a library technology specialty firm located in California, created a new online site designed specifically for Internet capable mobile phones.
The site, http://m.boulderlibrary.org, streamlines the Boulder library existing online features and fits them onto the screen of an iPhone, Blackberry or other so called smart phones.
With the touch of a button, users can search for a title, see book covers and find out how many copies are available and at which branches. The catalog contains all the materials available at the Boulder main library, the Boulder Meadows Branch, the Boulder George Reynolds Branch, the Carnegie Branch for Local History, the Louisville Public Library and the Eisenhower Public Library in Broomfield.
Fill out a name and library card number, and users can even remotely request that a book be put on hold for them.
&quot;It convenient for people who might be running around town and have their phone in their pocket,&quot; Hamilton said. &quot;We felt it was a good service to offer.&quot;

(NER-HARVEST "WESTMINSTER It an early evening on a Saturday in January, and if you re looking for parking among the metered spots that line the grid at The Orchard Town Center shopping mall in Westminster, you re out of luck.
An hour before show time, the 7 p.m. viewing of the movie &quot;Avatar&quot; at the AMC Orchard 12 IMAX cinema is sold out. People with tickets are even lining up behind a roped section of the newest movie house along the Interstate 25 corridor, waiting for good seats.
Even before &quot;Avatar&quot; was released, however, business at the open air mall has been good compared to the previous year.
According to the city of Westminster, city sales tax receipts at Orchard Town Center for October and November last year the most recent sales tax figures available were 12 percent higher than the same period in 2008.
That in contrast to two other high profile shopping malls in the region, FlatIron Crossing in Broomfield, and Twenty Ninth Street in Boulder, both of which are vying to pull, or hold on to, customers from parts of Broomfield and Boulder counties.
The Orchard, a roughly 1 million square foot mall situated on a former apple grove where 144th Avenue intersects with I 25, is competing for some of these same customers especially shoppers from Erie and Broomfield.
The shopping center opened in spring 2008, a few months before retailers nationwide experienced one of the most challenging economies in recent history.
&quot;We opened in one of the worst retail downturns,&quot; said Mary Beth Jenkins, president of The Laramie Company, a consulting firm that worked on Orchard development, and now handles the outdoor mall leasing. &quot;But all the tenants are reporting sales above their projections.&quot;
One of the mall smallest tenants, Which Wich, is one of the best revenue producers among the sandwich shop chain 80 stores nationwide, according to store manager Joe Lucero. While it draws a cross section of clientele, Lucero said, business has been particularly brisk because The Orchard sits within a few miles of three high schools Mountain Range in Westminster, and Legacy and Holy Family high schools in Broomfield.
While The Orchard business has grown in recent months, FlatIron Crossing late fall numbers were essentially flat and revenue at Twenty Ninth Street plummeted. For October and November 2009, sales tax revenue increased 1.8 percent at FlatIron the 1.5 million square foot retail outlet located just south of US 36 in Broomfield over the year before, according to city of Broomfield figures.
In Boulder, sales tax revenue from the 825,000 square foot Twenty Ninth Street dropped a whopping 28.9 percent in October and November 2009 from the same two months the previous year. The biggest drop came in November, when Twenty Ninth Street generated $250,043 of city sales tax, compared to $514,738 for November 2008.
In Westminster, however, business at The Orchard has benefited of late from the mall newness.
&quot;I think (The Orchard has) some really good momentum,&quot; said Nancy Rezac, general manager at The Orchard.
She said it took an initial holiday season, in 2008, and a year worth of outdoor programming to familiarize patrons with what the shopping center has to offer. The Orchard sponsored a weekly Farmers Market last summer and held a concert series during warm months, too.
&quot;I don t Pamela Sulin, left, and Julie Demelittle talk about movies over lunch at the Rock Bottom Brewery at The Orchard Town Center last week. Caitlin Staffer, spokeswoman for Rock Bottom Breweries, said the bar and restaurant draws patrons from east Broomfield and Erie, in addition to Westminster and communities east of Interstate 25. ( MARK LEFFINGWELL )think people quite understood who we were or what we were before that,&quot; Rezac said.
In addition, The Orchard was able to fill each of its four large anchor spots within a year of its official opening. Outdoor recreation retailer REI opened its doors last March, joining JCPenney, Macy and a Super Target, as the mall anchors. The Super Target gives shoppers an on site grocery option. A spacious Lifetime Fitness center has been an additional draw, Jenkins said.
Boulder and Broomfield malls haven t had such good fortunes when it comes to keeping its anchors filled.
Nearly 40,000 square feet of space at Twenty Ninth Street originally designed to be the a flagship Wild Oats store has been vacant aside from some seasonal occupants since the grocer sale to Whole Foods Market in 2007.
And FlatIron Crossing southern anchor was vacant for more than three years, after clothier Lord &amp; Taylor closed in 2005. The 120,000 square foot anchor space was finally filled this past year when mall owner Macerich Corp. decided to divide it, and three retailers, XXI Forever, the Container Store and Ultimate Electronics, landed there.
Heather Drake, marketing director for FlatIron Crossing and Twenty Ninth Street, said Macerich Corp., which owns both malls, paid attention when Orchard Town Center opened in 2008.
&quot;Any time any other retail option opens up in our trade area, we want to know about it,&quot; Drake said.
She said, however, while there is some retail duplication between The Orchard and FlatIron, Macerich doesn t think The Orchard has had a big impact on FlatIron business.
&quot;We look at it as FlatIron Crossing is still the super regional, enclosed shopping center with more than 200 retail choices, versus a smaller outdoor retailer with a smaller retail mix,&quot; Drake said. &quot;I think the market has proven to be able to support both.&quot;
The city of Broomfield has certainly taken steps to ensure possible competition from other area retail malls don t gouge FlatIron business. Historically, city sales tax from FlatIron has accounted for roughly 30 percent of the city annual revenue.
In the fall of 2008, the Broomfield City Council approved a plan to spend more than $20 million, half the projected cost of renovating the Village, the outdoor, entertainment oriented portion of FlatIron Crossing.
While the scope of the renovation has grown smaller since then plans to build a 140 room hotel at FlatIron have been scrapped work is ongoing.
As for Twenty Ninth Street, which pulls a vast majority of its customers from people with Boulder ZIP codes, Drake said Macerich conducted studies that found the Boulder open air mall hasn t been affected by The Orchard.

(NER-HARVEST "The University of Colorado has applied for multi million dollar federal grants to help finish the construction of its biotechnology building since the cash strapped state is rejecting the school funding requests.
CU Boulder campus split the building construction into two projects so that it could move forward on construction, without depending on state funding. The first phase of the building will be 257,000 square feet, and CU expects it to be finished in fall 2011. The school has plans for a 54,000 square foot addition, which hinges on funding.
Instead of waiting for an economic turn around at the state level which could leave construction on the final wing of the building stalled for an indefinite period of time CU is looking for money elsewhere.
Russ Moore, interim vice chancellor for research, said CU has applied for two federal stimulus grants from the National Institutes of Health that each amounts to about $15 million. University officials are waiting to hear back from the agency.
&quot;We have irons in the fire,&quot; Moore said.
University officials estimate that donations, federal dollars and the Boulder campus will cover the $148 million for the initial building, located on CU east campus northwest of Colorado Avenue and the Foothills Parkway, and hope that $31.8 million will eventually come through from the state to finish the biotechnology hub.
CU is requesting $26.95 million this year, but state officials have told school leaders to not expect the money because of the tight budget. The university was also hoping to secure $4.82 million for the building from the state next year. University officials are hopeful for both federal and state money.
Regardless, the university has listed the biotechnology building No. 1 on its capital construction wish list to demonstrate its importance, said Steve McNally, associate vice chancellor for budget and finance.
State leaders have celebrated the project and expect the biotechnology center will help create jobs in Colorado.
Gov. Bill Ritter, who attended the ground breaking of the building in September, said the research of complex biomedical problems that will happen in the building will give the state a competitive edge in the global market and stimulate the state business environment.
Colorado boasts particular potential in the biosciences, with existing businesses generating more than $400 million in state taxes and supporting 36,000 workers. At CU, biotechnology research has led to more than a dozen startup companies and attracts tens of millions of dollars annually in sponsored research grants.
The university has 57 doctorate biochemistry students more than double what CU officials predicted back in 2007 when the degree was approved.
So far, the state has only pledged $5 million toward the building. That money is coming from state &quot;economic development funds&quot; generated from gaming proceeds, which is a separate pot of money than the capital construction budget. The money will help CU biomedical team partner with the private industry and expand lab space.
School officials say they appreciate the state support, even though the construction funding requests are going unmet for a project that is lauded by state leaders.
&quot;It would be nice if we were in great economic times,&quot; Moore said. &quot;But at this point, we realize they have tough problems to solve, and we consider ourselves to be in a close partnership with them.&quot;
Moore said the &quot;humanitarian and economic impacts&quot; of the biomedical research that will be done in the building will be substantial.
The new biotechnology hub will bring together leading scientists, including 60 senior faculty members and more than 500 research and support staff members.
Together, they will collaborate and explore medical problems, looking to develop new therapies for cancer, infectious diseases and cardiovascular disease.
The scientists and engineers who make up the Colorado Initiative in Molecular Biotechnology will be housed in the building. Nobel laureate Tom Cech rejoined CU faculty last spring to head up the initiative, and he is also teaching undergraduate chemistry.

(NER-HARVEST "SALT LAKE CITY The American pika isn t heading for the endangered species list, but federal scientists say there no question it bears watching if the West continues to warm.
The US Fish and Wildlife Service formally announced its decision Friday that Endangered Species Act protections aren t warranted for the climate sensitive pika, a mountain dwelling relative of the rabbit that lives in 10 Western states. Pikas are common in the high elevation parts of western Boulder County.
Agency officials acknowledge, though, that there still plenty that not known about the pika, a species that can be difficult to study because of its remote mountain habitat.
Larry Crist, a Utah field supervisor for the US Fish &amp; Pikas, a mountain dwelling relative of the rabbit that lives in 10 Western states, will not receive Endangered Species Act protections the US Fish and Wildlife Service formally announced Friday. Pikas are common in the high elevation parts of western Boulder County. ( Richard Holmes )Wildlife Service, which reviewed scientific literature on the pika, said the creature can adapt and find suitable habitat despite a predicted summertime rise of 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit by 2050 in the animal current range.
&quot;We believe that in some low elevations pikas are likely to decline, but we see no danger of extinction through 2050,&quot; Crist said, adding that there are no reliable estimates of the creature total population.
Shaye Wolf, a biologist with the Center for Biological Diversity, a Tucson, Ariz. based nonprofit group, disputed the finding, saying that &quot;scientific studies clearly show that the pika is disappearing from the American West due to climate change.&quot;
A US Geological Survey study in 2003 found six of 25 pika populations in the Great Basin west of California had disappeared due to rising temperatures.
A federal biologist said Friday that the decision not to list the pika is just the beginning of what expected to be more intensive monitoring of the secretive species in the coming years.

(NER-HARVEST "Nine years ago this week, a spin off from Bell Labs settled in Longmont with the intention of commercially proving its breakthroughs in holographic memory technologies.
During the coming years, InPhase Technologies grew in size and potential, raising upward of $100 million in funding for development of its fast, high capacity holographic data storage disks. Five years ago, the company CEO said that by 2010, the firm would launch another generation of its disks with capacities around 1.6 terabytes.
Actions taken this week, however, are putting that and other promises in jeopardy.
Earlier this week, InPhase officials laid off the company 60 employees who had taken significant pay cuts in the previous months and closed the office after running short of funds, said Bart Stuck, an InPhase investor who said he has been involved with the company since 1996.
Stuck said the company is not dead.
&quot;We re actively engaged,&quot; said Stuck, managing partner for venture capital firm Signal Lake. &quot;We re trying to restructure the company, and we think there is a lot of promise there, and are working this thing through with the people there that hold the majority of the stock of the company.&quot;
Stuck said it should be a matter of &quot;days,&quot; not weeks or months, that a resolution could be reached.
If that is the case, officials would work to rehire employees and keep the company in Longmont, he said.
Nelson Diaz, InPhase chief executive officer, could not be reached for comment.
One of InPhase engineers was quoted in the Longmont Times Call earlier this week that he and his colleagues worked for a year on &quot;minimum wage for salaried employees,&quot; according to the newspaper. The unnamed employee said he was being paid $11 per hour, according to the Times Call report.
InPhase closure comes nearly two months after Copan Systems, another Longmont based data storage company, was reported as laying off the majority of its work force and shutting down.
Researchers at the Bell Laboratories of the New Jersey based Lucent Technologies developed the holographic technology behind InPhase beta data storage products in 1968. Efforts to further develop the technology intensified in 1993, Diaz told the Camera in 2001.
InPhase planned to use holography to record and store data on the surfaces and through the volume of disks similar in size to DVDs and CDs.
The highly specialized technology most likely didn t catch on with the enterprise and IT markets because of the economics associated with implementation, said Brian Babineau, a Silicon Valley based senior consulting analyst with the Enterprise Strategy Group.
Traditional mechanical disk drives have continued to decrease in price, plus numbers of systems are built around specific mechanical drive interfaces, he said.
&quot;This was going to require a significant change in technology consumption and storage consumption and the economic benefits aren t that compelling,&quot; he said. &quot;You have to buy their system in order to run, essentially, their holographic storage drives or media...
&quot;It not ubiquitous, and when you re competing against a familiar commodity product in a mechanical disk drive, you need ubiquity.&quot;
Babineau added that he sees InPhase best chances for survival to be if the firm positioned itself a supplier to a market other than enterprise data storage.

The University of Colorado regents next week will consider adding two new degree programs at the Boulder campus: a master in law and a doctorate in Asian languages.
As school officials make the pitch during tough economic times, the regents will review documents that show enrollment in some recently approved degree tracks is soaring past projections. The degree proposals also highlight the revenue potential of the programs, show there a high demand and outline how the disciplines fit into the school long term plan known as &quot;Flagship 2030&quot; which aims to prepare graduates for an increasingly competitive global economy.
The regents are expected to approve the new degree proposals at their board meeting Thursday in Colorado Springs.
CU School of Law is proposing a &quot;master of laws&quot; degree in three specialty areas natural resources, technology and intellectual property, and entrepreneurial law.
&quot;We picked these programs because they are what (CU) law is known for,&quot; said Elisa Dalton, a spokeswoman for the law school.
Once approved by the regents, the law school will start taking applications from students who have already earned their juris doctorate Litany Webster, a first year law student, works on her laptop in the student commons of the Wolf Law Building at the University of Colorado on Friday. ( MARK LEFFINGWELL )or foreign equivalent, Dalton said.
Regent Michael Carrigan, a CU law graduate, said the program will help CU attract top notch students and professors, as well as increase rankings.
The master program is expected to generate money for the law school in its first year of operation, and campus leaders say there is a high student demand for the degree track.
The program will break even with just five students, and the law school will pay 25 percent of the tuition revenue to the university. With tuition at about $33,000, the law school alone would bring in about $25,000 for each enrolled student.
No full time faculty members will be hired for the program, according to Dayna Bowen Matthew, associate dean for academic affairs and a law professor. However, existing faculty members will receive stipends to work with the master students.
The faculty stipends will equal the rate paid to adjunct law teachers, which is $1,750 per course credit.
The College of Arts and Sciences will also be seeking approval for a doctoral program in Asian languages and civilizations, with specialties in Japanese or Chinese. The Ph.D program would be the first in the Rocky Mountain region, according to CU officials.
Boulder campus leaders say there is a demand for the higher degrees because of the rising global position of China and Japan, and a resulting increase in undergraduate and graduate enrollments in the disciplines.
CU officials expect that the degree program would help draw grants from Asian funding agencies. The department has enough faculty members to support the Ph.D program, according to the College of Arts and Sciences.
Campus spokesman Bronson Hilliard said proposed degree programs don t need to be revenue generators to be approved. Take, for example, a high level science program that requires expensive equipment and additional teaching resources.
&quot;We re not going out, creating degrees to solve budget problems,&quot; Hilliard said.
The campus considers whether there is demand for a degree, or a gap in academic offerings, when it reviews new programs.
&quot;The professional schools have a nice combination of academic and public demand, and, in the process, they can realize revenue,&quot; Hilliard said.
Some degree programs that have emerged in the past few years have drawn more students than projected.
For example, the projected enrollment in chemical and biological engineering, which was approved in 2006 as a bachelor degree program, was 102 students this year. The actual enrollment is 188, according to a document prepared for the regents.

(NER-HARVEST "Meanwhile, education groups and advocates for the developmentally disabled and low income people who rely on government programs are urging lawmakers to pass the tax increases which the full Senate began debating Friday and avoid teacher layoffs and cuts to safety net spending.
In the middle are lawmakers who must find a way to close a $1.5 billion shortfall in this year and next year`s budget, and Republicans and Democrats are sharply divided on how to do that.
Democratic Gov. Bill Ritter proposed ending or suspending 13 tax credits and sales tax exemptions to raise about $125 million next year, and majority Democrats have been backing that plan in the Legislature.
Republicans say they want Ritter to cut more, pointing out that most of the budget balancing during the recession has involved one time fixes rather than reduced spending.
The biggest tax increase on the table would affect manufacturers like the Evraz Rocky Mountain Steel plant in Pueblo. The state doesn`t charge 2.9 percent sales tax on the energy used by such plants now. Under Ritter`s proposal, such plants would pay the tax for three years, raising about $33 million a year.
Evraz the state`s largest energy user after utilities says its energy bill would rise $2 million a year as a result, which could force it to cut 30 to 120 jobs. The plant has 1,000 employees.
The workers at risk are in the division that makes steel used in tires, rebar and chain link fences. It`s the part that`s most vulnerable to foreign competition and has seen numerous layoffs and reduced hours in the past two years.
Ben Lutze, the plant`s business director, said the division has enough work now but layoffs could be possible in the next six months if the tax increase is approved.
&quot;My fear is that looking at the past two years, that it is going to cause us to make some real tough decisions,&quot; he said.
The Pepsi Bottling Group, meanwhile, estimates that charging sales tax on soda would lead to a 1.9 percent to 2.8 percent drop in sales. That could lead to the loss of 370 to 800 jobs, mostly at stores and vending machine companies, it said.
But school districts and the teachers union say not moving ahead with the tax increases could mean thousands of teachers could lose their jobs and some smaller districts may have to close.
Ritter has already proposed a $260 million cut for kindergarten through 12th grade schools. The Colorado Education Association projects that could cause the loss of 5,200 teaching and professional support jobs like counselors, about a tenth of existing positions.
Failing to pass the tax hikes could mean another $132 million cut and the potential loss of another 2,600 such jobs.
Littleton Public Schools in suburban Denver, for example, is so far considering cutting 100 full time positions next year, district spokeswoman Diane Leiker said.
Members of each party believe the other is exaggerating the impact of the potential cuts and tax increases.
Sen. Greg Brophy, R Wray, compared the prospect of teacher layoffs to the federal government`s threat of closing the Washington Monument to get the budget passed.
He said government needs to make fundamental changes to live within its means and do more with less during the recession, including laying off state &quot;bureaucrats.&quot;
Sen. Evie Hudak, D Westminster, thinks people will continue to buy soda, candy and steel despite the sales tax. She said there`s no reason to exempt industry from paying a tax on fuel just like households do.
Hudak, who listened to testimony from steel workers and the online business owners until after midnight Friday, said lawmakers have to look at the big picture and not just the impact to those people came to the Capitol to fight the increases.
&quot;There are lots of faces in hospital rooms, in bedrooms and on the street who aren`t here and need our help even more,&quot; Hudak said.

Carnivore eats small insects to crayfish
First introduced to Colorado in 1888
Source: US Department of Wildlife, National Geographic
The book can be found at the Boulder Bookstore and Amazon.com. Author Anders Halverson will be at a book release event on March 4, 7 to 9 p.m. at Eaton Humanities, Room 150, University of Colorado.
More than a century ago, America government leaders wanted to encourage men to get back in touch with their primal abilities because they thought industrialization had diminished their masculinity, according to a new book written by a University of Colorado professor.
Their cure was to give them something to capture and kill. And so America waterways were stocked with a fish that fought the line and gave anglers just enough of a challenge: the rainbow trout.
In his new book, &quot;An Entirely Synthetic Fish: How Rainbow Trout Beguiled America and Overran the World,&quot; Anders Halverson, an ecologist and research associate at CU Center of the American West, discusses the history of one of America favorite game fish.
&quot;The thought was that the men will go out and fish, become strong and then democracy will be safe,&quot; Halverson said.
Halverson book, which was funded by the National Science Foundation, explores the rise and prominence of the rainbow trout in America environmental history, both in driving an industry and its continued dominance over native species.
Before the government began stocking rainbow trout throughout the nation, its natural range was along the West Coast CU professor and author Anders Halverson will be at a book release event on March 4, 7 to 9 p.m. at Eaton Humanities, Room 150, University of Colorado. from Alaska to Mexico with a little crossover into Nevada. Stocking is still a widespread practice except in Montana, which stopped stocking rainbows in streams and rivers that supported wild trout populations in 1974.
Now, for every three people in the US there is one rainbow trout stocked in many of its waterways, according to Halverson.
Anglers love rainbow trout for their fight they jump out of the water to avoid being caught and their size. The world record catch is 48 pounds.
&quot;They are the Goldilocks of trout. They are between the cutthroat trout and the brown trout. Cutthroat are really easy to catch, you could call them naive. The brown are different, referred to as well educated,&quot; Halverson said. &quot;Rainbow trout are right in the middle.&quot;
Fisheries managers tend to appreciate trout for a different reason: They are easier to raise in hatcheries than other fish.
&quot;A fish hatchery is a cross between a sacred cow and a military base no one wants to get rid of fisheries because they are a large component of local economies,&quot; Halverson said.
Halverson has fished his entire life. While growing up in Denver in the 70s, the rainbow trout was the state fish. The irony of honoring a non native fish as a state symbol, and the contradiction of getting out into the wild to catch a farmed fish, both became a central consideration in Halverson book.
&quot;There a fascinating paradox about fishing. A lot of anglers I see fishing as an escape of civilization and industrialization or a spiritual escape from society,&quot; Halverson said. &quot;Yet you have a paradox of most of the fish they catch are the product of industrialization.&quot;
The introduction of rainbow trout has also had environmental consequences. The fish are thought to hybridize with native trout, which affects their genetic structure and ability to survive.
There are more than a dozen types in Colorado with many considered either, threatened, endangered or at risk by the US Fish and Wildlife Service or the Colorado Division of Wildlife. Colorado state fish, the greenback cutthroat is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.
The most striking anecdote from the book for Jeff Mitton, a professor of ecology at CU who writes a science column for the Camera, was when Halverson wrote about the poisoning of 450 miles of the Green River in 1962. The government poured the poison, rotenone, into the river intending to create a clean slate for restocking with rainbows. The creation of the Endangered Species Act can by traced back to this poisoning, according to Halverson.
&quot;What should be done and what ought to be done has changed immensely. There was a time when no one saw a disadvantage to bringing in the rainbow trout,&quot; Mitton said. &quot;No one saw any downside, it was beautiful and fun to fish.&quot;
Mitton, who is well educated on the controversy of rainbow trout stocking, thinks the book fills a gap in understanding about an issue that is relatively unknown outside the fishing community.
The spread of stocking rainbows began as a response to what was perceived as a cultural problem and now it continues to meet demand by anglers and an industry built around it. Mitton said that it is hard to distinguish a right and wrong side to the issue.
&quot;There are honest differences of opinion that have the best of intentions,&quot; Mitton said. &quot;There aren t good people and bad people involved here.&quot;

(NER-HARVEST "Boulder University Hill business district in recent years has been knocked by some as a &quot;food court&quot; where sandwich shops and eateries seemingly outnumber other retailers.
While the Hill soon will be home to two new taco eateries Del Taco and La au Taco Shop and tapas restaurant Cafe Aion, the new additions proprietors say they welcome calls for the area revitalization and add that their businesses could play key roles in attracting a variety of demographics to the Hill.
Peter Howser, a 17 year Boulder resident whose children attend University Hill Elementary, said he is investing $500,000 in his Del Taco restaurant at 1100 13th St., a corner location that has been a revolving door for small eateries since Dairy Queen closure in 2006.
&quot;We re going to do some nice things ... and make it feel like a place that more people want to come,&quot; said Howser, who operates a Del Taco in Greeley. &quot;I m going to do a lot of marketing to families. (Del Taco restaurants) do really well with families and kids.&quot;
Noting that sales at his Greeley restaurant were up 20 percent in 2009, Howser said he optimistic that Del Taco price point will be welcomed by consumers who remain cost conscious amid a weakened economy.
&quot;Instead of going to Applebee, people are now coming to more of the quick service restaurants,&quot; he said.
Howser is targeting a mid May opening date for the restaurant.
When it opens, Del Taco won t be the only new taco shop in the area. The owners of the La au Taco Shop in Colorado Springs are planning to open a second location at the northern tip of the Hill at 1335 Broadway #B, the current locale of Boulder Mountaineering.
The future of Boulder Mountaineering a rebirth of the outdoor and climbing gear store that was founded on the Hill in the early 1970s is uncertain, owner Bob Culp said last week. In 2005, Culp reopened the new iteration of his gear store in one half of the building that housed music store SecondSpin for five years.
Since 2005, four different businesses have occupied the other half of the building, where Bleu Star Vintage operates now. Jamie St. John, who owns 1335 Broadway, said Culp plans to retire and La au &quot;unique&quot; offerings will be a good fit for his property. Culp could not be reached for additional comment.
St. John also said he plans to convert the top floor of the property into two apartments, a renovation he hopes will bring some business and add stability to the building tenants.
Joseph Coleman, a co founder of La au, is optimistic the restaurant will fare well in Boulder. The healthy and fresh items that include ingredients such as huli chicken, mahi mahi, napa cabbage and green papaya resonate well with athletes and young mothers in Colorado Springs and should be a hit in health conscious Boulder, he said.
&quot;Some of our most rabid fans are really serious athletes that are constantly looking for healthy fuel and others are mothers ... who want a light, fresh meal,&quot; Coleman said.
The hope is to open La au in late April or early May, but that timing could depend on the build out and any other city processes, he said. La au operators are in the process of applying for a new liquor license.
Cafe Aion is expected to be the first of the trio of new Hill restaurants to come on board when it opens by late March or early April.
The cafe is the brainchild of local chef Dakota Soifer, who purchased the Burnt Toast Restaurant, 1235 Pennsylvania, late last year.
Soifer said his focus will be on the offering of tapas, or small plates, and creating an intimate space that can be a place where university professors and young professionals gather and enjoy food and a nice glass of wine.
&quot;As of right now, there nothing to attract any new demographic,&quot; he said.

(NER-HARVEST "About 20 people attended the meeting, which focused on the budget shortfall facing the university.
&quot;We need more people to understand the situation we`re up against,&quot; said Tanya Kelly Bowry, a CU government relations officer.
University funds are being supplanted by money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, but ARRA is set to end next year, leaving questions about financing higher education.
CU Vice Chancellor Richard Porreca spoke, lauding the university for its Flagship 2030 plan, its &quot;green&quot; ranking and the &quot;best buy&quot; university ranking it received from Fiske Guide to Colleges, but expressed concern about the financial situation.
&quot;I can pretty much assure you as Chief Financial Officer that it is not sustainable,&quot; Porreca said. &quot;Our support from the state is relatively low ... we will continue to cut at the university.&quot;
The discussion covered the possibility of lifting the cap on foreign and out of state students at the university, and touched on some hurdles that legislatures have to overcome to fund higher education.
&quot;We have a number of constitutional amendments that really tie the legislators` hands,&quot; said Kelly Bowry, referring to the Colorado Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which limits the state`s ability to raise taxes. &quot;We`re trying to (fund the university) without raising taxes, because we`re not allowed to raise taxes.&quot;
Representative Hullinghorst said the state legislature is constitutionally required to balance the budget, and higher education takes a back seat to the programs that the state legislature is mandated to fund.
&quot;When the budget gets tight, the discretionary items, like higher education, have to be cut,&quot; Hullinghorst said.
To counteract the budget shortfalls, Hullinghorst proposed that some relief would come from removing any excessive tax credits for businesses.
&quot;We can take back some of the huge tax credits given to corporations in the `90s,&quot; Hullinghorst said. &quot;We can see which ones aren`t helping us.&quot;
Alternative sources of revenue were discussed, including the possibility of establishing reserve funds from severance taxes. One community member suggested that the state make cuts in prison funding to support education by releasing nonviolent offenders into rehabilitation services.
&quot;To be perfectly frank from a political perspective, the Republicans in the `80s used this as one of their major campaign components, and blamed Democrats for being soft on crime,&quot; responded Hullinghorst, although both representatives showed signs of agreement with the proposal.
Another community member raised doubts about CU President Bruce Benson`s ability to support higher education funding in the face of possible Republican opposition, but the representatives expressed support for the CU official.
&quot;He has surprised me in the extent to which he has butted heads with his former cronies,&quot; said representative Levy.

(NER-HARVEST "It that time of year again, when University of Colorado students begin the mad scramble for prime rental properties in hopes of locking down the perfect place for the fall semester.
With more available units in near campus this year, amenities are no longer just on the wish list they ve become a necessity for some students.
When planning your rental budget, don t forget to include extra expenses like:
Utilities: Ask the landlord if rent includes heat, water, trash or cable
Transportation: You may need to buy a bus pass, or pay for campus parking at your new location
Deposits: Find out how much the rent, pet or utility deposits will cost and whether they re refundable
Personal expenses: Determine whether groceries and other personal items will be shared between roommates or individual expenses
For more tips, visit colorado.edu/ocss.
University area rental vacancies have increased from 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 to 2 percent in 2009, according to the Colorado Division of Housing leaving students with higher expectations for their new pads.
CU junior Dana Foster, who attended a university sponsored off campus housing fair last week, is looking for a two bedroom rental that close to campus, pet friendly and has a dishwasher and plenty of storage.
&quot;I have a cat so that not negotiable,&quot; Foster said. &quot;We need a place that meets our needs, but keeps our rent under $1,400 a month.&quot;
But despite the extra vacancies, Foster said she finding it difficult to get everything she wants and stay within her budget.
Though extra vacancies are leaving more rental options for students, higher rents are forcing some students to make a choice between sacrificing amenities or their Carrie Scott, right, shows a rental property in Martin Acres to CU students Hannah Simmons, left, and Jessie Muckle last week. ( CLIFF GRASSMICK)budget.
The average cost of rent surrounding the Boulder campus is $806 per month, up $60 from this time last year, and amenities are only adding to the cost.
In the Denver metro area, including Boulder County, a dishwasher increases rent prices on average by more than $200 per month. Finding a place that pet friendly could cost an extra $100 per month. Add in the cost of extra storage, and Foster can expect to pay almost $400 more per month.
While some students may be able to have their cake and eat it, too, CU freshmen and roommates Vann Ellerbruch and Tony Elio said their budget mostly will dictate the property they choose.
&quot;We both pay our own way, so we have a strict budget we have to stick to,&quot; Ellerbruch said. &quot;It would be nice to find a place on the Hill or something with a washer and dryer, but it doesn t look like it in the cards for us right now.&quot;
Ellerbruch and Elio are planning to room with two other students in a four bedroom house, and even as freshman, they realize the competition for a property that size is stiff.
&quot;Single family homes are the quickest to go,&quot; said Tom Orlando, relocation director for Housing Helpers in Boulder. &quot;Anything on the Hill with three to six bedrooms is going to go fast.&quot;
For students searching for smaller one or two bedroom rentals, Orlando said now is a good time to start looking, but there not as much pressure to act quickly.
Other students attending last week housing fair said searching online is a convenient way to compare properties, and Off Campus Student Housing at CU is making it easier than ever with the launch of its redesigned Web site, Ralphie List.
At ralphieslist.colorado.edu, CU students, faculty and staff can access nearly 200 rental listings in the Boulder and Broomfield areas for free. Photos, amenities and prices can be compared side by side and students can use message boards to help find roommates, furniture or sublet opportunities. Students can also visit an on campus attorney for advice on leasing agreements or legal disputes with landlords or roommates free of charge.

(NER-HARVEST "Boulder police are investigating a report that a 20 year old University of Colorado student was attacked and robbed at knifepoint over the weekend.
Police spokeswoman Sarah Huntley said the man told officers that he was walking alone at 1:30 a.m. Saturday in the 1600 block of 17th Street when two Hispanic males approached him.
The men, described as about 21 years old and wearing all black clothing with hooded sweatshirts pulled over their heads, were walking in the opposite direction near 17th Street and Arapahoe Avenue.
Huntley said the men stopped as they approached the CU student and one of them pulled out a knife and held it at the man stomach. The knife wielding man told the victim to &quot;give me your money,&quot; according to Huntley.
&quot;He said he didn t have any money, but had a cell phone and lighter,&quot; Huntley said.
That when one of the men punched the student in the face. He fell to the ground, and both suspects began kicking him, Huntley said.
The men grabbed the cell phone from the victim hand and ran off toward University Avenue.
The student, left with bruises and cuts, made his way to a friend nearby house to call police. When his friend wasn t there, Huntley said, the man went home to use his roommate cell phone. The roommate also wasn t home, so the man waited until about 9 a.m. for him to arrive before finally calling authorities.

A new report shows that while college students have been shown to fail when it comes to understanding core civics, they become more liberal on controversial social issues during their pursuit of higher education.
The Intercollegiate Studies Institute a conservative think tank will officially release the report Wednesday that shows people with college degrees are more likely to support gay marriage and abortion and less likely to think that the Bible is the word of God.
The report, called &quot;The shaping of the American mind,&quot; says colleges nationwide fail to adequately teach civic knowledge an argument based on results of the institute past surveys but they do influence students when it comes to polarizing social topics. The authors conclude that if students had a better grasp of civic knowledge, they d be more likely to embrace free enterprise and the notion that anyone can succeed with hard work and perseverance.
In the report, 25 percent of respondents who earned only a high school diploma supported same sex marriage, compared with 39 percent of people holding a bachelor degree and 46 percent of those with a master degree.
Kevin Correa, assistant director of the University of Colorado Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender Resource Center, said he thinks students are introduced to more diversity and varying perspectives during college.
&quot;Those interactions lead people to start questioning what messages they received their entire lives,&quot; Correa said. &quot;College is a time when young adults start forming their own world views.&quot;
Gregory Carlson, president of CU College Republicans, said he become more conservative throughout his time in Boulder.
&quot;I definitely think that there is a liberal bias in most classes, and sometimes it unintentional,&quot; said Carlson, who abandoned his left leaning political beliefs after high school partly because of national security concerns following the Sept. 11 attacks.
Carlson said he thinks colleges face a challenging task when it comes to addressing a liberal bias, but he thinks CU would benefit from its planned &quot;Visiting Chair in Conservative Thought and Policy,&quot; an idea unveiled by campus leaders in 2007. The school is still in the fundraising phase for the $9 million endowment.
&quot;I think it important to hear all sides of issues,&quot; Carlson said.
The Intercollegiate Studies Institute polled about 2,500 randomly selected people. The new report is the fourth in a series that the group has released to advocate that universities adopt better balanced curricula and place more emphasis on the basics of American history.

(NER-HARVEST "DENVER Wearing life vests and carrying paddles, commercial Colorado river rafters vowed Monday to fight for their right to navigate the state whitewater rivers after a Texas development company threatened to shut them down.
At a rally at the state Capitol, Duke Bradford, owner of Arkansas Valley Adventures, said his company guides about 23,000 tourists a year down five Colorado rivers. He is worried that a threat by Lewis Shaw II, president of Jackson Shaw developers of Dallas, to file a civil suit would shut down a $142 million industry.
Bradford said Colorado law reserves the use of Colorado rivers for the people, not for landowners. The state attorney general has ruled commercial rafters cannot be prosecuted for trespassing, but that didn t settle the civil dispute.
&quot;He says we re compromising his property rights. He coming to Colorado from another state and disputing our historical use of the river, threatening to shut us down,&quot; Bradford said.
In December, the company sent commercial rafters a letter saying &quot;there is no credible interpretation of legal statute, case or authorization permitting rafting, floating or any transit through or over private property.&quot; Shaw threatened legal action if rafters or their customers touch the riverbanks or river bottom while on their property.
The property has been developed as a fishing resort on the banks of the Taylor River near Gunnison and the company contends rafters interfere with fishing.
Shaw said he gave rafters permission to use his property last year based on guarantees they would not interfere with fishermen. He said he was disappointed when hundreds of them took advantage of his offer, disrupting the fish, and he notified them he would not renew his offer this year.
&quot;I have this property and it like people are boating on your front lawn,&quot; he said.
The bill would give commercial rafters the right to navigate rivers in Colorado and limited rights to use the river banks to avoid obstacles.
Mark Schumacher, owner of Three Rivers Resort, said developers have already shut down rafting on the Lake Fork River after they persuaded the federal Bureau of Land Management not to reissue a permit. Permits are also issued by the US Forest Service and Colorado State Parks.
Rep. Kathleen Curry, an unaffiliated lawmaker from Gunnison, said North Dakota and Colorado are the only two states west of the Mississippi River that don t have strict protection for commercial rafters. She said Utah clarified its rules four years ago, making it clear rafters have access.
Curry acknowledged that rafters can interfere with fishermen and she said both sides need to respect each other rights. She said this issue has rippled throughout the West for decades, but states and the federal government have learned how to deal with it.
&quot;I d say rafting and fishing can coexist. That been out there for years, even though they might not be the best of friends,&quot; she said.

(NER-HARVEST "The proposal, which was set to be debated Monday in the full Senate, is part of an overall package of tax bills to cover a $1.5 billion shortfall due to the recession.
The amended measure (House Bill 1193) would require retailers like Amazon.com Inc. and Overstock.com Inc. to either start collecting sales tax on March 1 or send notices to their customers stating how much they spent with them in the previous year and telling them how much they owe in state sales tax.
Technically, everyone who buys items tax free online is supposed to file a form with the state at least once a year and pay the tax if the purchase would have been taxed by an in state company. But hardly anyone knows that or does it.
To help enforce the law, the bill would allow the state Department of Revenue to ask online retailers with annual sales of more than $100,000 to provide a list summarizing what each Colorado resident bought in the previous year.
Opponents say that could violate the privacy of customers if retailers have to list details of what books, for example, were purchased. But Phil Horwitz, the department`s tax policy director, said he thinks most retailers would simply choose to collect the tax to avoid the more unpleasant option of having to send tax notices to their customers.
As online sales have grown and state tax revenues have dropped, at least three other states New York, North Carolina and Rhode Island have tried to get out of state retailers to start collecting taxes. The US Supreme Court has ruled that only companies with a physical presence in a state have to collect taxes. However, these states have argued that people within their borders who earn money by linking customers to online stores called affiliates amount to stand ins for those out of state retailers and therefore require the online stores to collect taxes on all sales they make in the state.
Colorado was headed that same way until the state`s approximately 4,200 affiliates many of them small, home based businesses began warning lawmakers that online retailers would just cut ties to them, as they had done in those other states, causing them to go out of business.
The bill was changed earlier Monday to take affiliates out of the equation and instead focus on going after the retailers directly.
Sponsor Sen. Rollie Heath, D Boulder, said lawmakers should help protect those stores, which also support the state with their property taxes.
&quot;There`s no new tax. We`re just collecting what`s already on the books,&quot; Heath said.
However, the Colorado Retail Council, the trade group that represents many large stores, isn`t sure the new approach will work.
&quot;I hope they can make it happen,&quot; said Chris Howes, the council`s lobbyist.
If the bill becomes law, fiscal analysts expect it will bring in $4.7 million in the first full year of collections. It won`t be pure profit though. The state estimates it will have to spend $40,000 in the first year to pay for the expected lawsuit and $91,584 to pay for two employees one to investigate retailers and build a database to track information and the other to help with policy and legal research to respond to the potential lawsuit.

(NER-HARVEST "Longmont police are investigating a case of possible child abuse against a two month old baby, Longmont police Cmdr. Tim Lewis said.
A woman took her 2 month old son to Rocky Mountain Urgent Care, at the intersection of South Main Street and Pike Road in Longmont, with an arm injury on Monday afternoon, Lewis said. The doctor examining the baby boy discovered the infant arm was broken and he had other injuries. The mother could not explain how the baby arm was broken, Lewis said.
The doctor reported the case to police a little before 5 p.m. Lewis said broken bones raise suspicion of abuse in very young babies because they don t move around enough to break bones in other ways. Doctors are required by law to report suspected abuse.
Lewis said the baby is in the custody of the Department of Housing and Human Services while police investigate the case. That could take several weeks, he said.
Lewis said police are not releasing a description of the other injuries because the information is part of an ongoing investigation. Lewis said the baby does not have shaken baby syndrome.
The baby lived with his mother, father and an older sibling &quot;of toddler age,&quot; Lewis said. Police are trying to determine who else had access to the child.
&quot;Unfortunately, the 2 month old can t tell us what happened,&quot; Lewis said.
Lewis said the family has no history of domestic violence or child abuse investigations with the Longmont police. Police are not releasing the names of the parents. No arrests have been made.

(NER-HARVEST "That journey ends, while another begins, at what until a few months ago was a vacant Boston Market that sat empty for years. The Caos own Ooka, which opened in January at 6485 W 120th Ave. The restaurant offers sushi and a variety of Japanese, Chinese and Thai dishes.
Ooka isn`t the only restaurant in Broomfield looking for success where another restaurant failed.
Little Anita`s New Mexican Foods opened last month in Broomfield Marketplace on US 287. Its home originally was a Burger King that closed in 2008.
In a few weeks La Casita de Durango will move across Nickel Street into what until late last year was Lucky Four Cafe at 145 Nickel St.
Ooka`s three Cao brothers are veterans in the restaurant business, with several decades of experience between them. Owning a restaurant is a longtime ambition, and they are taking their shot in Broomfield.
&quot;The location is good, the people are nice and they want something new,&quot; Andy Cao said.
Little Anita`s is a family owned chain that started in Albuquerque, NM, and has opened five restaurants in Colorado. Most of the chain`s Colorado restaurants are fast food places, but the Broomfield restaurant offers sit down dining and table service.
Other prospective restaurant owners continue to nibble at the Broomfield market, Broomfield Economic Development Corp. president Don Dunshee said.
Part of Dunshee`s job is to field requests from businesses or commercial real estate brokers looking for vacant space, including restaurants.
&quot;We`ve had more inquiries for restaurants in the last 90 days than we had in the prior 15 to 18 months,&quot; Dunshee said.
The contacts typically are made by brokers, who keep their clients anonymous. The brokers seem to be working for restaurateurs looking at several communities and not just Broomfield, Dunshee said.
During past recessions, the BEDC would get inquiries from people who had lost their jobs and thought breaking into the restaurant business would be a good career change, Dunshee said. Not many people are looking to make that shift now, which actually is a good thing, as a high percentage of those efforts fail, he said.
But the opening of new restaurants in small spaces doesn`t remove the glut of large restaurant spaces that remain on the market.
The largest and most prominent is at 665 FlatIron Marketplace. The 10,500 square foot space was originally a Bahama Breeze, a national chain of tropical themed restaurants, which closed in 2004. For years, the building has sat empty, and weeds have started to crack the driveway and sidewalks while the building`s paint fades.
Other restaurants have tried to fill the space, but its large size makes it a major challenge, Dunshee said.
&quot;That`s a lot of bodies you need to (have) in there eating and drinking,&quot; he said.
Not far from the vacant Bahama Breeze is the vacant Bennigan`s at 588 Summit Blvd., which has been empty since the chain`s parent company filed for bankruptcy in summer 2008.
The decision to close Woody`s Wood Fired Pizza was made closer to home. The restaurant closed abruptly in September, informing the public and its employees of the location`s demise with a note taped to its front door.
The restaurant in the Broomfield Marketplace on US 287 was owned by Boulder based Concept Restaurants Inc. Locations remain open in Denver, Arvada and Fort Collins.
If Ooka, Little Anita`s and La Casita de Durango are successful and the Broomfield restaurant market picks up, there are other similar sized vacant spaces.
Ajuaa, another small chain of Mexican restaurants, closed its doors at 535 Zang St. three months ago, Dunshee said. Down the street at 520 Zang St. is a 1,300 square foot space that used to be Le Peep. The old Pei Wei in the Broomfield Town Center has been vacant since October 2008. And Legend`s Grille Sports &amp; Spirits, 135 Nickel St., closed in December.

(NER-HARVEST "Broomfield on Tuesday joined the list of Colorado cities to impose a moratorium on the opening of medical marijuana dispensaries.
Broomfield City Council voted 9 to 1 to institute a 180 day moratorium on the approval of any permits or licenses medical marijuana dispensaries would need to legally operate in the city.
The measure will let the state Legislature sort out new laws or regulations governing medical marijuana distribution before Broomfield attempts to act, City and County Attorney Bill Tuthill said.
&quot;As anyone can tell from reading the paper or watching the evening news, this is a rapidly evolving area of the law,&quot; Tuthill said. &quot;We would like the opportunity to have the chance to assess both legislative changes ... and we d also like to assess the different models that may exist for regulating medical marijuana in cities and towns.&quot;
About three dozen people turned out for the hearing, although only one person testified.
Broomfield resident Jeremy De Pinto spoke in opposition to the moratorium and said he was concerned it was a smokescreen while the city prepared to ban dispensaries.
&quot;You guys are going to do whatever you are going to do anyway,&quot; De Pinto said.
De Pinto said a ban would force medical marijuana users to obtain marijuana illegally from drug dealers.
&quot;What you guys are going to put a ban on is safe places for us patients to get our medicines,&quot; he said.
Several council members said De Pinto interpretation of their intentions was wrong.
The moratorium &quot;does not mean that we are never, ever going to have medical marijuana in Broomfield,&quot; Councilman Todd Schumacher said. &quot;It means if we do it in Broomfield, we ll do it in a careful and thoughtful way.&quot;
&quot;It not a condemnation of medical marijuana,&quot; he said.
Sam Taylor, the only council member to vote against the moratorium, said Broomfield is taking too long to institute a policy.
&quot;Six months is a little too long, and I think we need to move faster than that.&quot;
Mayor Pro Tem Walt Spader said the moratorium was a de facto deadline.
&quot;It telling the staff we expect some answers back in six months,&quot; Spader said. &quot;This isn t an attempt to drag this out.&quot;
Currently, Broomfield has one known medical marijuana provider. North Metro Caregivers is operated out of a mobile home in the Front Range mobile home park.
The city believes North Metro Caregivers is operating in violation of the Broomfield Municipal Code, but it is treating its violations as a code compliance problem, Tuthill said. It continues to distribute marijuana.
North Metro Caregiver fate was not discussed by council members.
&quot;We may end up asking him to cease his operations,&quot; Tuthill said after the meeting.

(NER-HARVEST "COLORADO SPRINGS A Republican University of Colorado regent suggested Wednesday that there be more political balance among faculty members, a proposal during a diversity discussion that didn t bode well with other board members.
Jim Geddes, R Centennial, said that as a leading university, CU should hire more conservative professors to replace retiring and outgoing faculty members. Intellectual diversity is the &quot;greatest challenge facing the university,&quot; Geddes said during the board meeting in Colorado Springs.
&quot;We are a public university serving Colorado,&quot; Geddes said. &quot;Our students come to us, and it no concern what their politics are, but it is a concern about those who are teaching our students.&quot;
The regents discussed a set of &quot;guiding principles&quot; that will be voted on Thursday and help establish CU mission. In the area of diversity, Geddes suggestion which emphasized political diversity among faculty was taken off the table.
The board became warmer to a proposal brought forward by Regent Kyle Hybl, a Republican from Colorado Springs.
The regents are poised to approve Hybl version, which says CU should: &quot;Promote faculty, student, and staff diversity to ensure the rich interchange of ideas in the pursuit of truth and learning, including diversity of political, geographic, cultural, intellectual and philosophical perspectives.&quot;
The more controversial version brought forward by Geddes said CU should promote diversity of protected classes and geographical and cultural spectrums. It also said CU should &quot;promote and insure intellectual diversity of its faculty including differences of political and philosophical thought and affiliation reasonably consistent with Colorado and the nation.&quot;
Regent Joe Neguse, a Boulder Democrat, said he worried the proposed principle would lead to quotas in order to achieve political diversity. Geddes responded that he doesn t favor quotas.
Neguse said that 2 percent of students at CU Boulder are African American and 6 percent are Latino.
&quot;We need to encourage and promote all kinds of diversity,&quot; he said.
Regent Michael Carrigan, a Denver Democrat, said professors political beliefs are irrelevant in many disciplines, pointing to the engineering college or at CU School of Medicine.
&quot;This is not the greatest challenge facing the university ... it taking a sledgehammer to a fly,&quot; Carrigan said.

(NER-HARVEST "Below are the most productive states, measured by graduation rates and how much public funding the schools receive:
Source: Delta Cost Project report on productivity, called &quot;The dreaded P word&quot;
Colorado leads the nation when it comes to churning out the most college degrees, but is among the last place finishers in the category of state funding for higher education.
The University of Colorado regents Thursday will review a report from the Delta Cost Project which examines the productivity of state colleges and universities, measured by the graduation rates of students and how much public funding state schools receive.
The report lists Colorado as the most productive state in the nation, with each degree and certificate costing $21,898 in state funds. The next on the list is Utah, with each degree or certificate costing more than $35,000 in public funds. The national average is $42,677.
&quot;We re proud of the productivity of our faculty and of our administrative efficiency,&quot; said CU system spokesman Ken McConnellogue.
But he warned that CU will not be able to sustain academic excellence with such low state funding.
On the Boulder campus, at the start of the July 1 fiscal year, the school general fund budget was $86.3 million. The campus has taken $12.9 million in cuts this year, and expects to trim another $9.4 million next year. The general fund, which is now $73.4 million after the reductions, covers CU operating costs, including employee salaries and utilities.
The lack of state funding will be the topic of an upcoming rally on CU Boulder campus next week, as students worry about shrinking state support and the possibility of tuition and fee increases.
The rally will be noon Wednesday at the Dalton Trumbo Fountain outside of the University Memorial Center. A broader higher education rally, involving students from colleges and universities across the state, will be at noon on March 3 at the state Capitol.
Evelyn Maguire, a CU freshman who pays in state tuition and is majoring in chemical and biological engineering, will be among the attendees of the Boulder campus rally. Her parents saved money for her first year of school, and she hoping financial aid and scholarships will help cover the rest of her education.
Maguire said she plans to live at home and commute to CU to save money.
She said she attending the rally because she wants to raise awareness about the need for higher education funding.
&quot;Most voters don t care about where cuts take money from, and because of this, our education system is losing out,&quot; she said.
The report that the regents will review shows that Colorado awards 30 degrees and certificates for every 100 people. The national average is 23.

(NER-HARVEST "That journey ends, while another begins, at what until a few months ago was a vacant Boston Market that sat empty for years. The Caos own Ooka, which opened in January at 6485 W 120th Ave. The restaurant offers sushi and a variety of Japanese, Chinese and Thai dishes.
Ooka isn`t the only restaurant in Broomfield looking for success where another restaurant failed.
Little Anita`s New Mexican Foods opened last month in Broomfield Marketplace on US 287. Its home originally was a Burger King that closed in 2008.
In a few weeks, La Casita de Durango will move across Nickel Street into what until late last year was Lucky Four Cafe at 145 Nickel St.
Ooka`s three Cao brothers are veterans in the restaurant business, with several decades of experience between them. Owning a restaurant is a longtime ambition, and they are taking their shot in Broomfield.
&quot;The location is good, the people are nice and they want something new,&quot; Andy Cao said.
Little Anita`s is a family owned chain that started in Albuquerque, NM, and has opened five restaurants in Colorado. Most of the chain`s Colorado restaurants are fast food places, but the Broomfield restaurant offers sit down dining and table service.
Other prospective restaurant owners continue to nibble at the Broomfield market, Broomfield Economic Development Corp. president Don Dunshee said.
Part of Dunshee`s job is to field requests from businesses or commercial real estate brokers looking for vacant space, including restaurants.
&quot;We`ve had more inquiries for restaurants in the last 90 days than we had in the prior 15 to 18 months,&quot; Dunshee said.
The contacts typically are made by brokers, who keep their clients anonymous. The brokers seem to be working for restaurateurs looking at several communities and not just Broomfield, Dunshee said.
During past recessions, the BEDC would get inquiries from people who had lost their jobs and thought breaking into the restaurant business would be a good career change, Dunshee said. Not many people are looking to make that shift now, which actually is a good thing, as a high percentage of those efforts fail, he said.
But the opening of new restaurants in small spaces doesn`t remove the glut of large restaurant spaces that remain on the market.
The largest and most prominent is at 665 FlatIron Marketplace. The 10,500 square foot space was originally a Bahama Breeze, a national chain of tropical themed restaurants, which closed in 2004. For years, the building has sat empty, and weeds have started to crack the driveway and sidewalks while the building`s paint fades.
Other restaurants have tried to fill the space, but its large size makes it a major challenge, Dunshee said.
&quot;That`s a lot of bodies you need to (have) in there eating and drinking,&quot; he said.
